Dear Mr De Morgan Will you send on the
enclosed to Mrs De Morgan. It explains the arrangements I have made in case she comes here,
& also that Lord L & myself have delayed our own departure until Satdy next. Our household & children however are already gone.
Now to mathematical business :
I think you have hit the right
nail on the head, altho’ my
confused notion of Differentials was [46v] not the only piece of puzzle & mistiness which constituted the impediments towards my comprehension ofXdu +Ydu =U. Therectifi=
dx dy
=cation of this however, has I
believe given me the key to the
remaining difficulties. If you
will be kind enough to read
the [‘following’ crossed out] enclosed observations, you will be able to judge how
far I now take a just view of the matter.
I find that when (a long time ago) I studied Chapter V, I never gave due importance to the conclusion
∆.u= du∆x1+ du∆x2+ du∆x3+&c dx1 dx2 dx3
+ {(∆x)2, (∆x1∆x2), &c, &c} deduced at the bottom of page 87,
as the result of pages 86, 87. My [47r] whole attention was given to the subsequent theorem of page 90,
“If u be a function of t in different
 
“ways &c, &c”, which I con= =ceived to be the only object in view, & that the equation of page 87 was of no consequence in itself, but merely means to
an end. This seems to have been an egregious blunder, since the whole theory of Differentials rests on the very part which
I [‘comparatively’ inserted] neglected, from [‘fancying it’ inserted] a merely subsidiary theory. I believe I am not wrong
in this present view of the
matter.
I cannot help here remarking
a circumstance which I [‘believe’ crossed out] think is almost invariably true respecting
all my difficulties & confusions
in studying. They are without any
[47v] exception that I can recal [sic], from misapprehension of the meaning
of some symbol, or [‘of’ inserted] some phrase
or definition ; & on no occasion
from either any error in my
reasoning, or [‘from’ inserted] any difficulty in
carrying on [‘any’ crossed out] chains of deductions correctly, however complicated or
profound or lengthy [‘these may be’ inserted]. I therefore have lately begun to ask myself,
whenever I am stopped, whether
I clearly understand what the
subjects of the reasoning are ; &
to go carefully over every verbal
[something crossed out] & symbolic representative of a thing or an idea, with the
question respecting each, “now what
“does it mean, & how was it got?
“Am I sure of this, in each instance
“involved in the subject?” This
may save me much future trouble.
I will send you my remarks tomorrow, [vertical text on 46r] as I want to look over them once more
           
first ; & today I have had enough of these subjects.
Yours very truly A.A.L

[48r]
Dear Mr De Morgan
Ashley
Sundy 13th Sepr
I am very much
obliged by your remarks & additions. I believe I now understand as much of the
points in question as I am
intended to understand at
present. I am much inclined
to agree with the paragraph
in page 48 ; for though
the conclusions must be
[48v] admitted to be most perfectly correct & indisputable, logically speaking, yet there is a
something intangible & a
little unsatisfactory too, about
the proposition.
I expect to gain a good
deal of new light, & to get
a good lift, in studying
from page 52 to 58 ;
though probably I shall be
a long time about this. I
could wish I went on
quicker. That is I wish
a human head, or my head
at all events, could take in
[49r] a great deal more & a great deal more rapidly than is the
case ; and if I had made
my own head, I would
have proportioned it’s [sic] wishes & ambition a little more to
it’s [sic] capacity. When I sit down to study, I generally
feel as if I could never
be tired ; as if I could
[1840] [added in pencil by later reader]
   
go on for ever. I say
to myself constantly, “Now today I will get through so & so”;
and it is very disappointing
to find oneself after an
hour or two quite wearied,
& having accomplished perhaps [49v] about one twentieth part of one’s intentions, perhaps not that. When I compare
the very little I do, with the
very much the infinite I
may say that there is to bedone; Icanonly
hope that hereafter in some future state, we shall be
cleverer than we are now.
I am
afraid I do not understand
what you were kind enough
to write about the Curve;
and I think for this reason,
that I do not know what
[164r] the term equation to a curve means. Probably with some
study, I should deduce that
meaning myself ; but having
plenty else to attend to of
more immediate consequence,
I do not like to give my
time to a mere digression
of this sort. I should
much like at some future
period, (when I have got
rid of the common Algebra
& Trigonometry which at
present detain me), to
attend particularly to this
subject. At present, you
[164v] will observe I have four
distinct things to [something crossed out] carry on at the same
  
time ; the Algebra ;
Trigonometry ; Chapter 2nd of the Differential Calculus ; & the
mere practice in Differentiation.
This last reminds me
that my bookseller has at last & with much difficulty got me Peacock’s Book ; &
I hope it will be of
great use, for it’s [sic] cost is £2..12..6 ! It was originally 30s. It is
[163r] coming here next week.
By the bye I have a
question to ask upon pages
203 & 204 of the Algebra.
In consequence of a reference
to page 203, in the 9th line
of the 25th page of the Trigonometry, I was induced
to look & see what it
related to. Reading on
afterwards to the bottom of
the page, I found
“A functional equation is an “equation which is necessarily “true of a function or functions “for every value of the letter “which it contains. Thus if,
[163v] “φx = ax, we have φ(bx) = “abx = b × φx, or
“φ(bx) = bφx” “is always true when φx
“means ax.”
So far I think is clear ;
but then what follows,
“Thus &c
“If φx = xα φα × φy = φ(αy)
“ φx = ax . . . φx × φy = φ(x + y)
“ φx=ax+b...φx−φy=x−y φx−φz x−z
“ φx=ax φx+φy=φ(x+y)
   
I cannot trace the connection. I suppose there is something I have not understood, in the explanation of the Functional Equation.
I hope before very long to have something further to send you upon Chapter 2nd
of the Calculus, either of success or of enquiry.
Has Mrs De Morgan returned yet, & how is Mr Frend?
With many thanks, Yours very truly
A. A. Lovelace

[50r]
Dear Mr De Morgan. I hope you have not by this time come to the conclusion that I have drowned the Differential Calculus at least (if not myself with it also) in the Seine or the Channel.
I am setting about work again now in good
[50v] earnest. To say the truth I find myself a little
bit rusty & awkward.
I have been some days
getting my head in again,
& it is not yet even
at all what it was.
However this will soon
mend, I doubt not. I
very easily lose a
habit, but then I very
easily re-form it. But
I am a little vexed at
this interruption. I was
going on so nicely. I
[51r] now write because I am in need of a little help
from you. Some points
from page 100 to page
103 are not perfectly
clear to me ; & as my
head is not at this
moment in it’s [sic] best working habits, I think instead of plaguing myself more about the misty
parts, I had better
apply to you ; for I
St James’ Sqre Saturday Morning
 
am inclined to get a
little worried about it, [51v] which is always to be avoided.
I should prefer seeing you to writing, on this occasion. I have at present no evening ; for tomorrow (Sundy) I happen to have some engagements at home.
But I would suggest,
(if it is not trespassing
too much on your time
& kindness) that I will
send my carriage to
bring you here on
Tuesday Morning at 12 past [52r] eleven o’clock. I propose sending for you thus, in
order to facilitate your coming. Or would you
prefer instead that I
should go to Gower St
at that hour on Tuesdy?
Will you tell
Mrs De Morgan, with
my kindest remembrances,
that (if agreeable to her)
I rather hope to be
able to spend Sunday
Evening (I mean tomorrow
week) with her & you
But my arrangements [‘for that time’ inserted] are not yet quite fixed ; so
I am not sure yet
what I shall be able
to do.
Pray believe me Yours very truly
A. A. Lovelace
   
[54r]
Dear Mr De Morgan. I
send you a large packet
of papers :
1 : Some Remarks & Queries on
the subjects of a portion of
pages 75 & 76 (Differential Calculus) 2 : an Abstract of the demonstration of the Method of finding the
nth Differential Co-efficient by
means of the Formula
Limit of ∆nu = u(n) (∆x)n
[54v] 3 : Some objections & enquiries on the subjects of pages 83,
84, 85.
4 : Two enquiries on two
Formulae in page[‘s’ crossed out] 35 of the “Elementary Illustrations”.
In addition to all
this, I have a word to
say on two points in your
last letter.
Firstly : that θ is a function
of a & h, (or in all cases
a function of one at any
rate of these quantities), is very clearly shown by you
in reply to my question.
But I still do not see exactly [55r] the use & aim of this fact being so particularly pointed out in the parenthesis at the top of page 80. It does
not appear to me that
the subsequent argument is
at all affected by it.
Secondly : I still am not satisfied about the Logarithms, I mean about the peculiarity
St James’ Square Friday Morning
  
which constitutes a Naperian Logarithm in what I call
the Geometrical Method,
the method in your
Number & Magnitude. I
am [‘now’ inserted] satisfied of the following : that there is nothing in
the Geometrical Method to
[55v] lead to the precise determination
of ε ; that ε is arrived
at by other means, Algebraical
means ; & then identified
with the k on HL of the
Geometrical Method. What
constitutes a Naperian Logarithm
in the Geometrical view, is
“taking k so that x shall
“expound 1 + x, or rather that
“the smaller x is, the more
“nearly shall x expound 1 + x.
But in this definition there
are two points that are still
mistytome: Idonot
see in what, (beyond the
mere fact itself), these
Logarithms differ from those
[56r] in which x does not
expound 1 + x. I cannot
perceive how this one
peculiarity in them, involves
any others, or imparts to
them any particular use,
or simplicity, not belonging
to other logarithms.
Also, I do not comprehend
the doubt implied as to
the absolute theoretical strictly-mathematical existence
of a construction in which
x shall expound 1 + x.
It appears to me that,
whether practically with a
       
pair of good compasses, or
theoretically with a pair of
[56v] mental compasses, I can as
easily as may be take any
[diagram in original]
line I please MQ greater than
OK or V , measure their difference
PQ which call x, then on
OH (= OK) lay down a portion
OM equal to this difference x
(not that I pretend this is
correctly done in my figure,
which is only roughly inked
down at the moment), &
[‘finally’ inserted] stick up MQ on the point M. Then x expounds MQ or
[57r] V +x, or 1+x. I can see
no difficulty in accomplishing
this, or any reason why these
can be only an approximation
to it. Neither do I very
clearly perceive that the
Base k would be
necessarily influenced by this
proceeding.
In short I take the real
truth to be that this view
of Exponents being wholly new
to me, there is some little
link which has escaped me,
or to which at any rate I
have not given it’s [sic] due
importance. But I think
I have now fully explained
[57v] what it is that I do not
understand.
Believe me
Yours very truly A. A. Lovelace
       
[I think this is in fact a letter to Mrs. De Morgan. The reference in the letter to Mr. De Morgan is pretty clear evidence for this. As for the salutation, the ‘r’ of what appears to be ‘Mr’ curls back on itself very slightly, in a way that is suggestive of AAL’s way of writing ‘Mrs’. Compare what we find here with, for example, her ‘Mr’ in Box 170, fol. 54r, and the ‘Mrs’ in Box 171, fol. 5r. Other points to mention, although these are by no means conclusive, are that the letter is much chattier than her usual letters to ADM, and that the letter ends ‘Yours most sincerely’, which, based on a glance through the letters from Box 171, was AAL’s usual way of ending letters to Mrs. De Morgan — her standard sign-off to Mr. De Morgan seems to have been ‘Yours most truly’.]
[58r]
My Dear Mrs De Morgan
I am very sorry
indeed at the extremely
dispiriting account you
give of yourselves ; & also
I am much disappointed
at losing the pleasure
of spending this evening
with you. I was
out when your note arrived,
[58v] but I hear from the
servants that it came
just after half past four
o’clock.
Can I, (as far as you
at present foresee), spend
next Sunday Evening
with you? I hope so,
for I believe it will
be my last [‘Sunday’ inserted] previous to going to Paris ; & I
have no week-day evening
disengaged to offer.
[59r] Another of the little mathematical epochs, that are so interesting to me, has arrived ; I mean
St James’ Square 6 o’clock
Sunday Evening
 
another Chapter of the Differential Calculus is
just satisfactorily completed ; & I have a whole bundle
of papers to submit to
Mr De Morgan upon it,
& one or two questions
to ask on some trifling
points in it that are
not perfectly clear. But
[59v] as it is not of a nature that immediately presses,
all this may I think
wait till I can come
to you. Meantime I
shall begin Chapter VI,
on Integration &c.
I have since I
saw you had such a
wonderful quantity of
occupations of various
sorts to get thro’, that
I feel a little surprised
how I have managed to
[60r] [‘got thro” crossed out] accomplish, even this much of the mathematics.
However I do not think
anything will ever manage
to oust the latter. Indeed
the last fortnight is
rather a convincing
proof that nothing can.
I have been out
either to the Opera,
German Opera, or
somewhere or other, every night. I have had music-lessons every morning, [60v] & practised my Harp too for an hour or two ; &
I have been on horseback nearly every day also. I
 
might add many sundries & et-ceteras to this list.
I must however maintain that the Differential Calculus is king of the company ; & may it ever be so !
Believe me
Yours most sincerely

10th Nov r
Dear Mr De Morgan. The
last fortnight has been spent
in total idleness, mathematically at least ; for we have had
company & been as they say gadding about. I must
set too [sic] now & work up arrears. But I have a
batch of questions & remarks
to send.
First — on Peacock’s Examples, which I have only now begun
[62v] upon:
What does he mean by adding
d x to every solution? It
appears to me a work of supererogation. I take the
very first example in the
book as an instance, and
the same applies to all : Letu=ax3 +bx2 +cx+e:
it’s [sic] differential, or du =
= 3ax2dx + 2bx dx + cdx
or (3ax2 + 2bx + c) dx.
I should have written, & in
fact did write : it’s [sic] differential or du = 3ax2 + 2bx + c.
I suppose that this form
[63r] is used under the supposition
that x itself may be a
function.
My result & the book’s do
not agree in one particular
in the 9th example, page 2,
& I am inclined to think
it is a misprint in the
latter : the Books says :
Let u = x2(a + x)3(b − x)4
du = {2ab − (6a − 5b)x − 9x2}x(a + x)2(b − x)3dx
  
and I say :
du = {2ab − (6a − 5b)x − x2}x(a + x)2(b − x)3dx In case it may save you
trouble, I enclose my working
out of the whole.
I do not the least understand
[63v] the note in page 2. Not
one of the three theorems it
contains is intelligible to me.
I conclude you to have the Book by you ; but if not I can copy out the note & send it to you.
Secondly — to go to your
Algebra : I think there is
an evident erratum page 225,
line 8 from the bottom, where
x−1 x−1 x−2 1+x+ n+ n· n+&c
should certainly be
x−1 x−1 x−2 1+x+x n+x n· n+&c.
I have a little difficulty
in page 226, the last line,
1−b x “= 1 ”.
223
223
[64r] “let 1+b = 1+x which gives b =
2x+1
In the first place I do not
feel satisfied that the form 1+b is capable of being
1−b
changed into the form
1+x . There are three x
suppositions we may make upon it , (supposing that it is capable of this second form) . x may be less
than b, in which case
the denominator must also
be less than 1 − b, and less
in a certain given proportion,
in order that the Fractional [64v] Expression may remain the same. xmay=b,in
which case the second form
can only be true on the

supposition that 1 − b = x = = b , or b = 12 .
x may be greater than b,
in which case the denominator of the second form must also be greater than 1 − b, in
a certain given proportion, in order that the Fractional expression may remain the same.
But secondly supposing 1+b 1−b
to be under all circumstances [65r] susceptible of the form 1+x ,
x
the Binomial Theorem, was
quite satisfactory to me, but
I have some remarks to make
on the second proof of it,
pages 211 to 213. I think
you well observe in the
note page 213, that the two proofs supply each other’s deficiencies ; for I like neither
of them taken singly.
The latter one is what I
should call rather cumbrous, especially the verification of
φn × φm = φ(n + m) by
[65v] actual multiplication in page 212, which is an exceedingly awkward & inconvenient
process in my opinion.
Then I am not at all sure that I like the assumption in the last paragraph of page 212.
It seems to me somewhat
a large one , & much
more wanting of proof than many things which in
  I cannot deduce from this equation b = 1 .
2x+1 Your last letter, on

Mathematics are rigorously & scrupulously demonstrated.
But these inconsistencies
have always struck me occasionally, and are perhaps only in reality the inconsistencies [66r] in a beginner’s mind , & which long experience &
practice are requisite to do away with.
The end of Euler’s proof, page 213, is not agreeable to me, and for this reason, that I cannot feel properly satisfied as yet with the little Chapter on Notation of Functions, and upon the full comprehension of this depends the force of the latter part of this proof.
I do not know why it
is exactly , but I feel I
only half understand that
[66v] little Chapter X , and it has already cost me more trouble with less effect than most
things have . I must study
it a little more I suppose.
I hope soon I
may be able to return to your Differential Calculus. At the same time , I never more felt the importance of not being in a hurry.
I fancy great proficiency
in Mathematical Studies is best attained by time ; constantly & continually doing a little . If this is so,
surely then the University
[67r] cramming system must be very prejudicial to a real
  
progress in the long run,
particularly when one considers
how very very little School-boys
are [‘generally’ inserted] prepared on first going to the Universities, with
anything like distinct
mathematical or even
arithmetical notions of the
most elementary kind.
I am now
puzzling over the Composition of Ratios , but I hope in
a day or two more I shall
get successfully over that.
It plagues me a good deal. [67v] I believe I thought some years ago, that I understood it ; but I am inclined to
think I certainly never did.
You see just at
this moment I am full of unsatisfactory obstacles ; but
I doubt not they will soon yield .
With kindest remembrances to Mrs De Morgan , I am
Yours very truly A. A. L
I think there is an erratum
in your Trigonometry, page 34, line 7 from the top :

Dear Mr De Morgan. This
is very mathematical weather. When one cannot exercise one’s muscles out of doors , one is peculiarly inclined to exercise one’s brains in-doors. Accordingly I have been
setting vigorously to work again , with much satisfaction.
But I am sorry to
say that I am sadly obstinate
[68v] about the Term at which
Convergence begins for the
Series (A) page 231 of Algebra,
and which we thought had
been made clear by you
on Monday Evening . I must
persist in thinking Convergence
begins at x33 , 2.3.4....32.33
and I have enclosed my Demonstration of my view of the case, & which seems to me as clear as possible.
At any rate this will
show you at once where my blunder is ; if I have
blundered, for I can hardly
think I have, so very palpable [69r] does the proof appear to me.
The other night I had
unluckily been 10 days or
more without thinking about
anything of the kind , and
consequently the [‘whole’ inserted] thread of the argument was not present to
me ; or I might have
spared you & myself this
   
trouble now.
I have thought with much pleasure of my agreeable evening on Monday , mathematical & educational.
Yours most truly A. A. Lovelace
[69v] [a child’s scribbling?]

[70r]
Tuesday. 22nd Dec r
Dear Mr De Morgan I now see
exactly my mistake. I had
overlooked that the Series in
question is not one in successive
Powers of x [‘like that in page 185’ inserted], but only in successive even powers of x.
I used once to regret these sort of errors, & to speak of
time lost over them. But I
have materially altered my
mind on this subject. I often gain more from the discovery
of a mistake of this sort, than from 10 acquisitions made at [70v] once & without any kind of difficulty.
There is still one little thing in your Demonstration not perfectly clear to me. At the end
you remark that “our result “gave the 503d Term instead of “the 502nd, which arose from “taking the whole number next
“above 􏰏x + 14 instead of an
“intermediate fraction.”
In examining the equation
n = next whole number above
5 + 1􏰏1000,000+ 1 424
I see clearly that 54 + 12 (1001) is greater than 5 + 1􏰏1000,000+ 1;
Ockham
     424
that the true answer would be 5+1􏰊1000+1􏰋,1 beingsome
42 aa
[71r] fraction. We should then have
 had,
n = nearest whole number above

5 + 500 + 1 , instead of = 4 2a
= 45 + 500 + 12
But, since 54 is greater than 1, the result must exceed 501 even if we neglected the 41 altogether; and therefore at any rate n
(the next whole number above
5 +1􏰏Z+1),mustbe502,& 424
n + 1 consequently = 503 .
I do not therefore see that the
fact of taking 1001 instead of
the real square part of Z + 14
does account for the discrepancy
in question .
[71v] I have now some question to
put respecting certain operations
with Incommensurables. Thanks to
your Treatise I think I understand
[‘this subject’ inserted] pretty tolerably now. But there are still one or two points of
Practical Application which I
am [something crossed out] busy in working up previous to leaving the subject
altogether as a direct study, &
which I find not quite plain
sailing.
I have been writing out in
the Mathematical Scrap-Book,
a full explanation of the
operations with Incommensurables
analogous to those of Multiplication,
Division, Raising of Powers &c,
and a day or two ago I was
[72r] about completing it with that
analogous to the extraction of
Roots, when I found I did
not fully understand the
process, that is beyond the
consideration of one Mean
Proportional. I have written
out & enclose my explanation
for one Mean Proportional,
      
& my difficulty in the case
of two or more Mean Proportionals.
Also, I wished now to return
to the passage, page 29, lines 8
and 9 from the top, (Trigonometry) which first suggested to me the necessity of studying the subject
of Incommensurables; in order
that I might see if I could
[72v] now demonstrate the Proposition
of (46), for θ and sin θ Incom=
=mensurable quantities. But I do
not find that I can. I believe
I understand the example referred
to in (4), the long & short
of which I understand to be
that if in the Right-Angled
Triangle [diagram in original] A, B, C are
Incommensurables, and V be any
given linear unit, then the
RatiocompoundedofA:V andA:V
added to the Ratio compounded of
B:V &B:V,isequaltothe
Ratio compounded of C : V and
C:V.
With respect to the Ratio of an
Angle with it’s [sic] Sine, I began to
[73r] write it out as follows, after the
manner of pages 68 & 69 of the
Number & Magnitude:
θorθ:1istheRatioof AB AO
sinθorsinθ:1istheRatioof BM,
AB : AO, BM : AO being
Incommensurable Ratios, what
then does θ really mean? sin θ
In the first place we may consider it to mean
θ 1 :1,oraRatio sin θ
 compounded of the Ratio θ : 1 and 1 , or compounded of the
sin θ
Ratios AB : AO and AO : BM.
AO

But further than this I cannot get, nor see my way at all.
I conclude that in Incommensurable language, a Ratio equal to 1 or
a Ratio approximately to 1 can
[73v] only mean a Ratio in which
the Magnitude constituting the Antecedent is equal to the
Magnitude constituting the Consequent, or is constantly approaching an equality to it,
and therefore that if we take
the above Ratio compounded
of AB : AO and AO : BM, or
the Ratio AB : BM, & prove
that AB constantly approaches
in equality to BM, that is the
desired Demonstration.
I can only end by repeating
what I have often said before,
that I am very troublesome,
& only wish I could do you
any such service as you are
doing me. Yours most truly
A. A. L

Ockham
Dear Mr De Morgan. We have had company ever since I
last wrote to you, so I have been at a Stand-still, &
only yesterday was able to
read over with attention your replies. I am reluctant to trouble you again with remarks
ontheSeries1+x2 + x4 +&c, 2 2.3.4
for it seems as if I was determined to plague you
about it. However I feel I
must do so. Your added
[74v] remarks of last time, about B &c, are quite clear in themselves, but I felt at
once that they did not
meet my difficulty which
was that as long as 45
(which is greater than 1) is to
be added to 1􏰏1000,000+ 1, 24
it matters not whether for
􏰏1000,000+14 wesubstitute
the whole number next above
it or “the intermediate fraction” alluded to by you in the line √ I have marked [mark a bit like her ‘ never can bring out n = to
anything less than 502, whence
n + 1 the required term must
[75r] be 503. This, after reading
over & over, remains in my
mind a most obstinate fact,
and I believe I have found
out the real source of the
discrepancy between the result
at the bottom of the first
page & the top of the Second
’], but we
   
one. I am presumptuous
enough to think there is
certainly an error in your
writing out, in the line I
have marked X, & it is one
which is very likely to have
occurred in writing [‘it’ crossed out] in a hurry.
The (n + 1)th term divided by
the nth is I believe not
[75v] Z ,but Z , (2n−2)(2n−3) 2n(2n−1)
and I have re-written & now
enclose the rest of the demonstration (exactly like yours) with this correction. The result comes
out as I expected, owing to
41 taking the place of 54 ,
& everything appears to me
consistent. the nth term
divided by the (n − 1)th term
would be, (as you have
written) Z , & this (2n−2)(2n−3)
correction would do instead of
the others, & be perhaps [‘a’ inserted] more simple mode of making it,
as your demonstration would
[76r] then remain correct, the nth
term being in that case the
required unknown one instead
of the (n + 1)th.
I am afraid all this is a
little complicated to explain
in letters, & perhaps I have
still not succeeded very
perfectly in doing so; but
I feel it now all very
clear in my own mind,
& am only anxious to receive
confirmation as to my being
right, both as satisfactory
to me in the present instance,
& as tending to give me
    
[76v] confidence in future in my own conclusions, or, (if I am in this case puzzle- -headed), a due diffidence of them.
I therefore beg your indulgence for being so teasing.
Believe me
Yours most truly A. A. Lovelace

Dear Mr De Morgan. I send
you the [‘Series’ crossed out] Analysis of the new Series I received in your
letter yesterday morning. I
believe I have made it out
quite correctly. In fact, the
Verification at the end proves
this. But, owing to a
carelessness in my [‘first’ inserted] inspection of it, I have had the
trouble & advantage of analysing
two Series. I glanced too
hastily at it, & did not
observe that the factors of the
[77v] Denominators (of the Co-efficients), are not powers of 2, but
simply multiples of 2.
If you will open my Sheet,
you will find on the inside
my analysis of the Series I at
first mistook your’s [sic] for;
and I am not sorry this
has happened. I believe
both are correctly made out.
You kindly request me
if I do not understand the
erasure in the former [‘small’ inserted] paper, again to return it &c. Now
I do not agree to it; & [‘I’ inserted] still fancy that we are in fact
meaning exactly the same
thing, only that you are
[78r] speaking of the nth Term, & I
of the n + 1th. For
convenience of reference I again
return the former large paper
(& at any rate H. M’s
Post-Office will benefit).
I quite understand that
Ockham
 
1 +1􏰏106 +1 +aislessthan 424
501. Therefore as n is
the next whole number above
this fractional expression, x =
= 501. But n is not the
Term sought; the unknown
term to be determined being
by the conditions of the
Hypothesis & Demonstrations,
n + 1, & therefore = 502.
And if you will examine
[78v] your own [‘former’ inserted] Verification, you will see that you there
determine the Term at which
Convergence begins, to be
A502, or the 502nd Term,
which agrees with my
result n + 1 = 502.
I think it is quite clear
that we are both agreed,
but that you were not aware
at the moment you made
the erasure that I was
not speaking of the next
wholenumber above1+1􏰏106+1+a 424
but of the next but one above it.
So much for the three Series:
Now I must go to other
[79r] matters. I am indeed sending you a Budget.
I have been working hard
at the Differential Calculus,
& am putting together some remarks upon Differential Co-efficients (which in due
time will travel up to
Town for your approbation),
but in the progress of which
I am interrupted by a
slight objection to an old
       
matter of Demonstration,
which did not occur to me
at the time I was studying
it before, & sent you a
paper upon it [‘from Ashley’ inserted]. In the course of the observations I
[79v] am now writing, I have [‘had’ inserted] occasion to refer to the old
[‘general’ inserted] Demonstration, (pages 46 & 47 of your Differential Calculus),
as to the finite existence of
a Differential Co-efficient
for all Functions of x; &
a slight flaw, or rather what appears to me a flaw, in the conclusions drawn, has occurred to me. It is most clearly
proved that, θ being supposed to diminish without limit,
the Fractions Q1, Q2 &c
must have finite limit, for
some value or other at all events of nθ or h. But the fractions in question do not [80r] appear to me to be strictly speaking analogous to ∆u ,
 ∆x
except the first of them φ(a+θ)−φa
 θ
and the last of them φ(a+nθ)−φ(a+n−1θ) ,
 and for this reason.
In the expansion ∆u or
θ
∆x φ(x+θ)−φx , as θ alters
 θ
x does not alter, but remains
the same. In these fractions
on the contrary, which all have the form φ(a+kθ)−φ(a+k−1θ)
θ
and in which a + k − 1θ [bar over k − 1 should have little downward-pointing hooks at the ends]
stands for the x of the
expression ∆u or φ(x+θ)−φx,
∆x θ not only does θ alter, but
from the conditions of the
  
Hypothesis & Demonstrations, k − 1θ [80v] & consequently a + k − 1 θ must likewise alter along with θ.
There is therefore a double
alteration in value going on
simultaneously, which appears
to me to make the Case quite
a different one from that
of ∆u , & consequently to ∆x
invalidate all conclusions deduced from the former with respect to the latter.
The validity of the Conclusions with respect to the fractions Q1, Q2 &c, you understand
I do not question. What I question is the analogy between these Fractions & the Fraction
∆u or φ(x+θ)−φx [‘of’ inserted] which ∆x θ
[81r] latter it is required to investigate the Limits.
I also have another slight objection to make, not to the extent of Conclusions established respecting the Fractions Q1, Q2 &c having finite limits,
but to the Conclusions on that point not going far enough,
not going as far as they
might : “either these are
“finite limits, or some increase “without limit and the rest “diminish without limit ; if the “latter, we shall have two “contiguous fractions, one of which “is as small as we please, and
“the other as great as we please, “&c, &c, a phenomenon which “which [sic] can only be true when [81v] “Qk is the fraction which is “near to some singular value
“of the Fraction, & cannot be
      
“true of ordinary & calculable “values of it &c.” Now it appears to me that in no possible case could such a phenomenon as this be true, when we consider how the fractions are successively formed one out of the others by the substitution of a + θ for a, θ too being as small as
we please. I therefore think
it might have been concluded
at once that there must
always be finite limits to
the Fractions Q1, Q2 &c,
[82r] and this whatever k or nθ
may be. I suppose it is not
so, but I cannot conceive
the Case in which it could
be otherwise.
I do not know if in writing
upon my two difficulties in
these pages 46, 47, 48, I have
expressed my objections (especially
in the former case of the
fractions Q1, Q2 not being
similar to ∆u ) with the ∆x
clearness necessary to enable
you to answer them, or indeed
to apprehend the precise points
which I dispute. It is not
always easy to write upon
these things, & at best one
must be lengthy. I shall be
[82v] exceedingly obliged if you will also tell [‘me’ inserted] whether a little Demonstration I enclose as to
the Differential Co-efficient
of xn, is valid. It appears
to me perfectly so; & if it is,
I think I prefer it to your’s [sic]
in page 55. It strikes me
   
as having the advantage in
simplicity, & in referring to
fewer [‘requisite’ inserted] previous Propositions.
I have another
enquiry to make, respecting something that has lately occurred to me as to the Demonstration of the Logarithmic & Exponential Series in
your Algebra, but the real
truth is I am quite ashamed
[83r] to send any more; so will
at least defer this.
I am afraid you will indeed
say that the office of my mathematical Counsellor or Prime-Minister, is no joke.
I am much pleased to
find how very well I stand work, & how my powers of attention & continued effort increase. I am never so happy as when I am
really engaged in good earnest; & it makes me most wonderfully cheerful & merry at other times, which is curious & very satisfactory.
What will you say when [83v] you open this packet? Pray do not be very angry, & exclaim that it really is too bad.
Yours most truly A. A. Lovelace

Dear Mr De Morgan. Many thanks for your reply to my enquiries. I believe I now
understand about the limit of φ(x+nθ+θ)−φ(x+nθ) not
θ
being affected by nθ being a
gradually varying quantity.
I think your explanation of
it amounts to this : that
provided [something crossed out] (x + nθ) varies only towards a fixed limit, either
of increase or diminution ; then
[84v] the result of the Subtraction
of φ(x+nθ) from φ(x+nθ+θ)
remains just the same as if,
(calling (x + nθ) = Z), Z were
a fixed quantity. Now
by the conditions of the Demonstration
in question, (in your pages
46 & 47), when a decrease
takes place in θ, a certain
simultaneous increase takes
place in n. That is to
say, suppose θ has at any
one moment a certain value
corresponding to which n has
the value k. If I alter
θ to a lesser value χ, then
say that the corresponding
[85r] value of n, necessary to fulfil
the constant condition nθ = h,
is not k, but k + m = p.
What happens now? Why
as follows, I believe : there
were, before θ became χ,
k fractions ; there are now
k + m, or p fractions.
In [‘each of’ inserted] the k former fractions, [something crossed out] Z will
Ockham
      
have diminished, towards a
fixed limit [‘of diminution’ inserted] x ; in [‘each of’ inserted] the m new fractions introduced, Z
will be greater than in the
old k fractions ; but there
is a fixed limit of increase,
h, which it can never pass,
[85v] up to the very last Term
of the Series of Fractions.
Therefore tho’ the quantity
x + nθ or Z varies necessarily
with a variation in the value
of θ, yet it varies within
fixed limits either of
diminution or increase, & thus
the result of the subtraction
φ(Z +θ)−φ(Z) is not
affected.
I hope I have made
myself clear. I think it is
now distinct & consistent in
my head.
I see that my proof of
the limit for the function xn
is a piece of circular argument, [86r] containing the enquiry which I was in fact aiming at
in the former paper, but
which required to be
separated from the confusion attendant on my erroneous statements on other points.
I merely return the old
paper with the present one, because it might perhaps be convenient to compare them.
On the other side
of the sheet containing the
remarks on aθ−1, you θ
will find an enquiry which struck me lately quite by accident in
   
[86v] referring to some old matters.
I ought to make many apologies I am sure for
this most abundant
budget. I am very
anxious about the matter
of the successive Differential Co-efficients, & their finiteness & continuity. I think it troubles my
mind more than any
obstacles generally do. I
have a sort of feeling
that I ought to have understood it before, &
[87r] that it is not a legitimate difficulty.
With many thanks, Yours most truly
A. A. Lovelace

Ockham Weddy 3d Feby
Dear Mr De Morgan. I have a question to put respecting a condition in the establishment of the
conclusion
φ(a+h) = φ(n+1)(a+θh) in ψ(a+h) ψ(n+1)(a+θh)
page 69 of the Differential Calculus. I have written down, & enclose, my notions on the steps of the reasoning used to establish that
[89v] conclusion. So that you may judge if I take in
the objects & methods of it.
The point I do not understand, is why the distinction is made, (&
evidently considered so important a one), of “ψx
“being a function which has “the property of always “increasing or always decreasing, “from x = a to x = a + h,
“in other respects fulfilling the “conditions of continuity in “the same manner as φx”.
[90r] For this, see page 68, lines 9, 10, 11, 12 from the top ; page 68, line 12 from the bottom ;
page 69, lines 7, 8 from the bottom ; &c
I see perfectly that this condition must exist, & that without it we could not secure the denominators
     
(alluded to in page 68, line
13 from the bottom), being
all of one sign.
But what I do not
understand, is [something crossed out] why the condition is not made
[90v] for φ x also. It appears to me to be equally requisite for this latter ; because if
we do not suppose it,
how can we secure the
numerators φ(x + k∆x)−
−φ(x + k − 1∆x) being all
of one sign ; & unless they
are all of one sign, we
cannot be sure that they
will [something crossed out] when added, so destroy one another as to
give us φ(a+h)−φa ;
an expression essential to obtain. I think I have explained my difficulty, &
[something missing here?]
[the following written vertically on 89r]
believe me
Yours most truly
A. A. Lovelace
 
[beginning of letter seems to be missing] [91r] (unless the limit for vn−wn
v−w
is dispensed with in the
demonstration for the Binomial
Theorem, which it is not
in your Algebra, nor am
I aware that it can be
dispensed with in any of the
elementary proofs of that
Theorem). It had not
struck me that, calling
(x + θ) = v, the form
(x+θ)n−xn becomes vn−xn . θ v−x
And by the bye, I may
here remark that the curious
transformations many formulae
can undergo, the unexpected
& to a beginner apparently
[91v] impossible identity of forms
exceedingly dissimilar at first
sight, is I think one of
the chief difficulties in the
early part of mathematical
studies. I am often reminded
of certain sprites & fairies
one reads of, who are at
one’s elbow in one shape
now, & the next minute in
a form the most dissimilar,
and uncommonly deceptive,
troublesome & tantalizing are
the mathematical sprites &
fairies sometimes ; like the
types I have found for them
in the world of Fiction.
[92r] I will now go to the question
I delayed asking before :
In the development of the
Exponential Series
ax = 1+(loga)x+ (loga)2x2 + &c, 2
and the Logarithmic Series
log a = (a − 1) − 21 (a − 1)2+ &c
       
deduced from it ; I object
to the necessity involved of
supposing x to be diminished
without limit, a supposition
[‘obviously’ inserted] quite necessary to the completion of the Demonstration. It has
struck me that though this
supposition leaves the Demonstration
& Conclusions perfect for the
cases in which x is supposed
to diminish without limit, yet
[92v] it makes it valueless for the
many in which x may be
anything else which does not
diminish. No by the bye,
I think I begin to see it now ;
IamsureIdo. Itisas
follows : the supposition of
x diminishing without limit
is merely a parenthetical
one, by means of which a
limit for a certain expression
ax−1 is deduced under those x
circumstances ; & then the
argument proceeds, that having
already obtained in another
place, a [‘different’ inserted] limit for this same expression under the same
[93r] circumstances, we at once deduce the equality of these two limits, from whence follows
&c, &c. Thus this supposition of x diminishing without limit, is not a portion of the main argument, but only a totally independent & parenthetical hypothesis introduced in order to prove something else which
is a part of the main argument. Yes this is it, I am sure. I had
had the same objection to
        
the Demonstration in Bourdon,
to which I have had the
curiosity to refer. I am
[93v] sometimes very much interested in seeing how the same
conclusions are arrived at
in different ways by different people ; and I happen to
have been inclined to compare
you & Bourdon in this
case of developing Exponential
& Logarithmic Series ; and
very amusing has it been to
me to see him begin exactly
where you end, &c. Your demonstration is much the
best for practical purposes.
His is exceedingly general, &
the vast number of substitutions [94r] of one thing for another make it lengthy, & by no means very simple to follow. But it
is very well occasionally to
make these comparisons.
We are going to
Town on Monday the 25th,
for two or three nights, &
I will ask Mrs De Morgan’s
& your permission to spend
Monday Evening with you,
going towards 8 o’clock,
as I did before. It would
give me great pleasure, &
may perhaps be not only
agreeable to me, but of use
[94v] too, as there are one or two
points [something crossed out] relating to my future plans which I rather think of
speaking to you upon.
By the bye, Lord Lovelace & I are both of us much vexed, at our own
   
negligence in letting the Xmas Vacation go bye [sic], without proposing to you & your
lady & children to visit us
here, which you might
perhaps have been able to do during Holiday-time. I fear
you may now be unable to
think of it ; but pray consider [95r] the question with her ; if not for any immediate use, at
any rate for the next occasion. The fact is, that we have
so much the habit of thinking of you only in connexion
with Town & engagements there, that it only suddenly occurred to us whether you might not
be able to breathe country
air like other people.
You would come by Railway, & we would send the carriage to the Station for you.
Yours most truly A. A. L

[96r]
Dear Mr De Morgan. Had I waited a day or two longer,
I need not have troubled
you with my letter of Weddy, & I can only reproach
myself now with having been
a little too hasty in my examination of the Theorem in pages 68, 69, and having
sent you an enquiry which
certainly indicates some
negligence. I fear this letter
[96v] may not be in time to
stop one from you. [something crossed out] However I will try to
send it by an opportunity this afternoon.
But, to show you that I
now understand the matter completely :
In the first place the question
of the Denominator, or the
Numerator, being all of the
same sign, in such [something crossed out] collection of
expressions as
a−b , c−a , d−c, e−d &c
m−n p−m r−p q−r
has nothing whatever to do
with the letters effacing each
other when the above are
[97r] put into the form, (a−b)+(c−a)+(d−c)+(e−d) &c ;
(m−n)+(p−m)+(r−p)+(q−r)
whether (a − b), &c be positive or negative, or some one &
some the other, still a−b+c−a+d−c+e−d &c
Ockham Satdy 6th Feby
[‘1841’ added by later reader]
    m−n+p−m+r−p+q−r must = e−b
q−n
In the second place, the

Denominator must be all of the same sign, in order
to fulfil the conditions of the Lemma in page 48 ;
& this is the reason why
the condition is made respectively ψ x always increasing or
[97v] always decreasing &c.
For φ x, it matters not
whether it alternately increases
& decreases (provided always that it be continuous).
I believe I now
have the whole quite clear;
& I shall be more careful
in future.
I enclose a paper upon
pages 70, 71, 72, 73.
It is merely the general argument, put into my own order & from ; & I send
it in order to know if
you think I understand as much about the matter as [98r] I am intended to do.
You know I always have
so many metaphysical enquiries & speculations which intrude themselves, that I never am really satisfied
that I understand anything ; because, understand it as
well as I may, my comprehension can only be
an infinitesimal fraction of
all I want to understand
about the many connexions
& relations which occur to
me, how the matter in question was first thought of [98v] or arrived at, &c, &c.
I am particularly curious
   
about this wonderful Theorem. However I try to keep
my metaphysical head in order, & to remember Locke’s two axioms.
You should receive this about 6 o’clock this evening, if not before. I fear you will
have written to me today however. Believe me
Yours most truly A. A. Lovelace

[100r]
Ockham Park Friday. 19th Feby
Dear Mr De Morgan. I have one or two
queries to make respecting the “Calculus of Finite Differences” up to page 82.
Page 80, line 4 from the top, “remembering . . . . “.... that in φ′′(x+θω), θ itself is a function “of x and ω, &c” ; Now, neither on examining
θ as here used & introduced, nor on
referring to the first rise & origin of θ in
this capacity, (see page 69), can I discover
that it is a function of x and ω here, or
a function of the analogous a and h in
page 69. I neither see the truth of this assertion, nor do I perceive the importance
of it (supposing it is true) to the rest of
the argument & demonstration in page 80.
There is also a point of doubt I have
relating to the conclusion in lines 15, 16 from [100v] the top of page 79 :
It is very clear that the law for the Co-efficients being proved for un, and for ∆un, follows immediately & easily for un+1, or un + ∆un.
But if we now wish to establish it for un+2, we must prove it true not only for un+1, but also for ∆un+1 :
To retrace from the beginning : the
object in the first half of page 79 evidently
is to prove firstly, that any order of u,
say un can be expressed in term [‘of,’ inserted] or in a Series of all the Differences of u ; ∆u,
∆2u, ∆3u, ........... ∆nu ;
Secondly, that the Co-efficients for this Series follow the law of those in the Binomial Theorem.
Now the first part is evident from the
law of formulation of the Table of Differences ; Since all the Differences ∆u, ∆2u, ∆3u &c aremadeoutofu,u1,u2 &c,itis
obvious that by exactly retracing & reversing the process, we can make u, u1, u2 &c
[101r] out of ∆u, ∆2u, ∆3u &c.
   
For the second part of the above ; if we
can [something crossed out] show that the law for the Co-efficients holds good up to a certain point, say u4 ;
and also that being true for any one
value, it must be true [something crossed out] for the next
value too ; the demonstration is effected for
all values :
Now the fact is shown that it is true up
to u4. (I must not here enquire why the
fact is so. That is I suppose not your
arranging, or any part of your affairs).
It is shown that the two parts u3, ∆u3 of
which u4 is made up are under this law,
& therefore that u4 is so. And next it is
shown that any other two parts un, ∆un
being under this law, their sum un+1
must be so. But this proves nothing
for a continued succession. un+1 being
under this law does not prove that ∆un+1
is under it, & therefore that un+2 is under it.
[101v] There seems to me to be a step or condition
omitted.
I am sorry still to be obliged to trouble
you about f x, f′x, f′′x, I cannot yet
agree to the assertion that the result would
not be affected by discontinuity or singularity
in f′x, f′′x, &c. The result it is true
would not be directly affected ; but it surely
would be [‘indirectly’ inserted] affected, inasmuch as the conditions of page 69, necessary to prove that result,
could not be fulfilled unless we suppose
f′x, f′′x .. . . . f(n+1)x continuous &
ordinary as well as f x. To arrive at the equation φ(a+h) = φ(n+1)(a+θh) ψ(a+h) ψ(n+1)(a+θh)
page 69, it is a necessary condition that
φx, φ′x, φ′′x ......... φ(n+1)x be all
continuous & without singularity from x = a to x=a+h. Andtheφ′x,φ′′x.....φ(n)x,φ(n+1)x of page 71, could not fulfil this condition
unless f′x, f′′x .. . . . f(n)x, f(n+1)x did so
[102r] also. I fear I am very troublesome about this.
     
I have remarks to make respecting some of
the conclusions of the Chapter on Algebraical Development ; but they will keep, and
therefore I will delay them, as I think
I have send abundance, & I have also
some questions to put on the last 8 pages
of your “Number & Magnitude” on Logarithms.
On the Differential Calculus I will only
now further say that on the whole I believe
I go on pretty well with it ; and that
I suppose I understand as much about it,
[something crossed out] as I am intended to do ;
possibly more, for I spare no pains to do
so.
Now for the Logarithms : I had not till now
read the last pages of your Number & Magnitude,
& there are certain points I do not fully
understand. The last line of the whole, on
the natural logarithms is one. I cannot
[102v] identify the constituent quality of the natural
logarithms there given, with the constituent
qualities I am already acquainted with thro’
other relations & means : I know [‘for instance’ inserted] that the natural logarithms must have 2.717281828
for their Base ; that is to say that the
line HL, or A (OK, or V being the linear
unit) should be 2.717281828 V units.
Now I do not see [‘but’ inserted] that the condition in the
last paragraph of the book is one that
might perfectly consist with any Base whatever.
To prove that I understand
the previous part, at least to a considerable degree, I enclose a Demonstration I wrote out of the property to be deduced by the Student, (see second paragraph of page 79), & which I believe is quite correct.
Pray of what use is the Theorem
(page 75, [‘& which’ inserted] continues in page 76)? I do not see that it is subservient to anything that
[103r] follows ; and it appears to me, to say the

addition to a subject already sufficiently
    
complicated & cumbersome. The passage I mean is from line 13 (from the top) page 75, to the middle of page 76.

Dear Mr De Morgan. The reply to one of my queries to you, dispatched on Friday, has I believe just occurred to me. Probably
this letter will cross one from you tonight, but the remaining points continue still unsolved, so that I shall be equally glad
if I do receive an answer tomorrow morning.
The difficulty I have solved is
the one relating to the law for the Co-efficients
of [‘the series for’ inserted] ∆un. I remarked that the law for the
Co-efficients of the Series for un being
ascertained, did not ascertain those for ∆un
as a necessary consequence. But I see I am
wrong. If a Series is obtained for un,
[104v–105r] we have only in order to obtain one for
∆un, to take the Difference of every term
[‘of the’ crossed out] , (that is of the variable part of every
term), of the Series for un. Thus,
un being=u+n∆u+nn−1∆2u+····+nn1∆n−2u+n∆n−1u+∆nu 22
∆un must = ∆u+∆(n∆u)+∆􏰊nn−1∆2u􏰋+···+∆􏰊nn−1∆n−2u􏰋+∆(n∆n−1u)+∆(∆nu) 22
= ∆u + n∆2 u + n n−1 ∆3 u + · · · + n n−1 ∆n−1 u + n∆n u + ∆n+1 u 22
Whence &c, &c. I think this is quite sufficiently obvious.
But I now have another query to put, in the place of the one I have just disposed of, relating to the development in page 83,
∆u=amxm−1 +Axm−2 +·····+Px+Q andinwhichIcannothelpthinkingthereisamistake[‘inthefirstTerm’inserted]: Imake out that
it ought to be
∆u=amωxm−1 +Axm−2 +····
But I enclose my developments and observations therefore, on a longer & more convenient sheet. I will only add here, that we move to Town on
Thursday; and that I should much like to spend Sunday Evening with
Mrs De Morgan & you, if this arrangement is suitable & agreeable to you. I [105v] should arrive as usual, about 8 o’clock
I believe I shall have by the end of this
week several papers ready to discuss.
You see I do not waste my time, at
any rate; and I only hope that I am
  
not the means of wasting yours either. Believe me
Yours very truly A. A. Lovelace

[106r]
Dear Mr De Morgan. You are perhaps surprised that I have not sooner troubled you again.
And you may think it a very bad reason to
give, that I have done nothing. We returned
here on Tuesday, & now I am working away famously, & hope I have before me 7 or 8 months of ditto. You left me at page 106. I remember your enquiry if I were sure that I understood
􏰌 b+k fx × dx as developped [sic] in pages 102, 103. I b dt
answered confidently, that I did. I now enclose
you my own development of this Integration, that we may be quite certain of my comprehension of [something crossed out] it. On the other page of my sheet, is the application of it to 􏰌 udv = uv − 􏰌 vdu
(page 105); & to 􏰌 x 1 dv dx (page 107). a vdx
I have now two questions to propose.
I differ from you in my development of 􏰌 1 dx
1+x
I subjoin my development: Let v = 1 − x
􏰌 1 dx=􏰌 1 ×−(−1)dx(whichisonly 1−x 1−x
another way of writing 􏰌 1 .1.dx) 1−x
Andas dv or d(1−x) =−1,wemayinthe dx dx
abovesubstitute􏰌 1 dx=􏰌 1 ×−􏰑d(1−x)􏰒dx 1−x 1−x dx
Or􏰌 1dx=􏰌 1 ×−dvdx v v dx
= 􏰌 1 dv .(−1)dx which by v dx
􏰌 budx = b 􏰌 udx (see page 105) is = (−1) 􏰌 1 dv dx
or = − 􏰌 1 dv dx v dx
Nowsincebyline4,􏰌 1dvdx=􏰌 1dv= v dx v
v dx
= log v + C, it follows that
(— this same expression) must = −(log v + C)
= −(log(1 − x) + C) = − log(1 − x) − C =log 1 −C
1−x [107r] Now how do you get rid of (−C)?
Ockham Park Ripley
Surrey 4th July
 [106v] I cannot see why the Constant C is omitted in this more than in 􏰌 1 dx.
1−x
(see page 107)

My second question is unconnected with any of your books. But I think I may venture to trouble you with it. In the two equations,
V=gT (1)
S = 21g.T2 (2)
which you will at once recognise, I want to
know how (2) is derived from (1).
Will you refer to Mechanics (in the Useful
Knowledge Library), page 10, Note, which is
as follows, “Let S be the space described by the
“falling body. V = dS = gT. Hence dS = gT dT, dT
“which being integrated gives S = 21g.T2.”
Now can I [‘as yet’ inserted] understand this application of
Differentiation & Integration?
I conclude that dS here means dT
Diff. co of S with respect to T, S being (by Definition & Hypothesis) a function of T, & of V IknowthatV =gT
And that V = TS But I neither see how
V = dS , nor how the subsequent Integration applies.
dT
[107v] The object, I need not say, is the solution of S.
I mean to work very hard at my Chapter on Integration &c, now. And I hope this
summer & autumn will see me progressing
at no small rate.
How is the Baby? And does Mrs De
Morgan enjoy Highgate? I [‘am’ inserted] enjoying the country not a little, I assure you.
Yours most truly A. A. Lovelace
 
[108r]
Dear Mr De Morgan. It is perhaps unfair of me to write again with a batch of observations & enquiries, before you have had time to reply to the previous one. But I am so anxious to get the present matters off my mind, that I cannot resist dispatching them by this post.
I have two series of observations to send,
one relating to the passage from page 107, (line
8 from the bottom), to the last line of page 108;
the other to certain former passages in pages 99,
100 & 103, concerning which some questions have
suddenly occurred to me quite recently.
I shall begin with pages 107 & 108: I enclose
Ockham Sunday. 6th July
  you my development & explanation of 􏰌 √xndx up a2 −x2
 to􏰌 xndx =−xn−1√a2−x2+(n−1)a2􏰌 xn−2dx −(n−1)􏰌 xndx √√√
    a2 −x2 a2 −x2 a2 −x2 from which you will judge if I understand it
so far. I should tell you that I have not yet
begun page 109.
I will now ask two or three questions : 1stly: page 107,
[108v] (line 3 from the bottom): “the diff. co of a2 − x2 being (−2xdx) &c”. This surely is incorrect ; & you will see that
in my development I have written it as I fancy
it should be “being = (−2x), &c”
2ndly: page 108, (lines 8, 9, 10 form the top) : “By 􏰌 UdV
“we mean ············· p. 102, where
“the values of ∆V in the several terms are
“different, but comminuent.” I do not see that
this is a case of page 102 rather than of page 100 ; in other words, that the increments in this Integration are “unequal but comminuent”.
3dly: the subtraction in line 15 from the top, of
(n − 1)xn−2 × dx for d.(−xn−1) appears to me quite inconsistent with the inseparable indivisible
nature of a diff. co.
4thly: Lines 9, 10 from the bottom, “We have therefore “&c ··········· that of √a2 −x2xn−2dx”.
Admitted, most fully. But 􏰌 √a2 − x2xn−2dx does
not answer exactly to 􏰌 vdx or 􏰌 √vd2u, and
            
therefore it appears to me that this Integration is
not strictly an example of lines 5, 6, 7 (from the bottom)
of page 107. You will remember that −xn−1 was = 2V ,
therefore the xn−2 of (√a2 − x2xn−2) is equal to (−1) × 2V
 or −1 .2V . So that another factor −1 enters into the xx
x
[109r] expression which was, as I understand it, to answer strictly to 􏰌 vdu or 􏰌 √vd2u
5thly (line 5 from the bottom) page 108: I think there
is an Erratum. Surely 􏰌 􏰑 a2xn−2 − xndx 􏰒
√√
  a2 −x2 ought to be 􏰌 􏰑a2xn−2dx − xndx 􏰒
a2 −x2
√√
a2 −x2 a2 −x2
  I don’t know if my pencil Sheet enclosed will be very intelligible, for it is as I wrote
it down at the time quite roughly, & without any very great amplitude or method.
I now proceed to my series of observations relating to former pages, beginning with page 102, (line 10 from the bottom)
“+ less than nCΩ2 , or ChΩ”; 22
now in order to [‘effect’ inserted] the substitution of ChΩ for nCΩ2 22
the latter is resolved into C.nΩ.Ω2 , & [‘for’ inserted] nΩ is
substituted h. But by the hypothesis & conditions,
h must be less than nΩ. Therefore it does not
necessarily follow that that which is proved less than
nCΩ2 , is also less than ChΩ. You see 22
my objection.
2ndly. See Note to page 102 : If the “completion of the [‘first’ inserted] Series” [109v] in this page is unnecessary, surely it is equally
unnecessarily in the first Series of page 100 ; for the
same observation applies to the latter as to the
former, viz : that the additional term is
comminuent with w.
3dly. See page 99 (line 8 from the bottom) :
“􏰌xφx.dx=(x−a)a+(x−a)2 =x2−a2” a22
This is another form of 􏰌a+h xdx = ha+ h2 8 lines a2
above, & of the limit of the summation for φx = x in the previous page. And therefore it appears to me that it ought to be
􏰌xx.dx=(x−a)a+(x−a)2 =x2−a2 a22
I do not see what business φx has.
       
Now at last, I have done troubling you. I am very anxious on all these points. With many apologies, believe me
Yours very truly A. A. Lovelace

[110r]
Dear Mr De Morgan. Since dispatching my letter yesterday, I remember that I have not even
quite fully & correctly stated the whole points
Ockham Monday. 6th July
of difference [‘between’ inserted] 􏰌 √a2 − x2xn−2dx and 􏰌 √vd2u. I think I stated that 􏰌 √a2 − x2xn−2dx = 􏰌 √vd2u.−1,
   that in other words the 1st side differs from
x
􏰌 √vd2u in containing a factor 􏰊−x1􏰋. But
it differs also in containing dx as well,
which in writing yesterday I omitted I believe
to notice. So that 􏰌 √a2 − x2xn−2dx = 􏰌 √vd2u.(−1).dx st 􏰌√ x
 or the 1 side differs from vd2u in containing −x1.dx. Is not this what I ought
to have stated? Or is there still any confusion?
I also wish to observe upon
what I wrote on Friday as to the application
of the Differential & Integral Calculus to gt2 , [110v] that I am aware this formula [‘e = gt2 ’ 22
inserted] can be
derived from V = gt, by the simple Theory of algebraical proportion ; but that I was anxious to know how it is derived in the other way.
I will with your leave [‘(which I do not wait for)’ inserted], send you my paper making it out on the doctrine of
Proportions.
You must tell me if I presume too much
on your kindness to me. I am so
engaged at present with my mathematical
& scientific plans & pursuits that I can
think of little else ; & perhaps may be a
plague & bore to my friends about [something crossed out] these subjects ; for after my interruption from
Paris & London pursuits & occupations, my
whole heart is with my renewed studies ; &
every minutia even is a matter of the greatest
interest.
Believe me
Yours most truly
A. A. Lovelace
    
[111r] [something crossed out] You [‘will receive’ inserted] two papers on e = gt2
tomorrow
evening, or Weddy. One of them is to show the absurdity of the supposition that the spaces might
be as the velocities ; [‘& that’ inserted] on merely abstract grounds it could not be.

Ockham Park
Sunday. 11th July [‘1841’ added by later reader]
Dear Mr De Morgan. I enclose you a paper
(marked No 1) from which I think you will see that
I now quite understand the real relationship
between 􏰌 √xndx and 􏰌 √a2 − x2xn−2dx ; & that a2 −x2
  I [something crossed out] am now aware I wanted to apply to the latter what is not intended to be directly applied to it at all ;
& that [‘my’ inserted] getting both du and dx in, was a
complete puzzle & blunder. For where a few lines
 previously (−n − 1) 􏰌 √a2 − x2xn−2dx is substituted for 􏰌 √a2 − x2 × (−n − 1)xn−2dx, du ceases of
  course to enter under the Integrated quantity, [something crossed out] since it has been decomposed & otherwise distributed.
I am still occupied on pages 108, 109, 110,
& hope to complete to page 112 during this week. I
find this part requires studying with great care.
I think you anticipated this.
I must now thank you very much for your two
letters ; & will proceed to notice one or two points
[112v] in your replies to my enquiries.
I see that in objecting to what I called the
division of dV , when dV is substituted for dx
dV dx, I took a completely wrong view of the dx
matter. It does so happen that the expression
(derived from a separate & distinct Theorem) which
we may substitute for dV dx coincides in dx
form with what we may call the numerator dV
of the diff co. But the dV that is substituted is
not therefore derived from dV , at least [‘not directly or’ inserted] from dx
the decomposition of that which is indecomposible [sic]. I return again my former paper (marked No 2.)
with a clearer explanation of what I intended to convey by the term equivalent ; a term which it seems I had no business to use in the application which I [‘there’ inserted] meant to make of it.
I enclose (marked No 3) my answer to your “Try “to prove the following. It is only when y = ax
“(a being constant) that dy = y ” I do not feel dx x
quite sure that my proof is a proof. But I think
       
it is too.
Nowaboutv=gtands=12gt2 ;asubject
which troubles me not a little.
Is the following a correct development of the note in
Useful Knowledge Mechanics? I re-copy the notes first ;
[113r] “V = dS = gT. Hence dS = gT.dT, which being dT
“integrated gives S = 12g.T2”
[something crossed out on two lines]
The Integral of dS dT or of gT.dT will dT 􏰌
obviously give us S ; & we know that
= 12 gT 2 + C, (by formula of page 104 of the Calculus).
But it appears to me that the statement
above “Hence dS = gT.dT” is an unnecessary
intermediate step :
It is true that 􏰌 dS dT = 􏰌 dS, dT
that is providing we extend the theorem 􏰌 fxdxdt = 􏰌 fx.dx
dt
to the case when fx = 1, which I conclude it is allowable to do, since 1 may be considered a function of anything, I imagine ; thro’ the formula
fx = 1. But tho’ true, yet the above [‘clause’ inserted] appears fx
to me [‘an’ inserted] unnecessary introduction. I am not sure that I have explained myself well.
With respect to this formula
12gt2, & it’s [sic] derivation & application ; I have
referred as you desired to pages 27, 28, & have [113v] fully refreshed my memory upon them. But I do not feel this helps me much. In this first
place the process is the converse of that I enquired upon. S is there give, & V is to be derived
from S. My position was ; V given, & S to
be derived from V .
I understand the process of pages 27, 28, considered as a distinct & separate thing. But I do not identify it with Differentiation or Integration.
I, (knowing by abstract rules & theorems) that 2x is the diff co of x2, see that the limit 2t
which comes out, might be perfectly well expressed by d(t2). And that we may put the result
dt
of the Differentiation of t2, and the result of all the reasoning of pages 27, 28, indifferently one for the other. But I only see it as I see that
 gT.dT =
       
in the processes 12 ÷ 4 = 3 1 + 2 = 3 we
might indifferently put the results (3, in both cases)
one for the other. There may, for anything I yet
see or understand, be as little connection between
the abstract process of Differentiation and the
Stone-falling process, as between the above processes
of Division & Addition, which latter tho’ their results
agree, cannot be identified, or one made to represent
[114r] the other.
I apprehend [something crossed out] you will perhaps answer me here, that I must wait patiently for Chapter 8,
in which (page 143) I see something very like an
explanation of all I want. At the same time
I think it better to express fully my difficulties.
I am very anxious to see your Comments on
my two papers [‘sent the other day’ inserted] upon 12gt2. For I do not see where the flaw in them can be ; & yet I suppose
there is one. It is some comfort in the confusions
& puzzles one makes, that they are always
exceedingly amusing to me, after they are cleared
away. And this is at least some compensation for the plague of them before.
With many thanks,
Yours most truly A. A. Lovelace
   
[115r]
Dear Mr De Morgan. You must be beginning
to think me lost. I have been however hard at work, with the exception of 10 days complete interruption from company. I have now many thing to enquire. First of all; can I spend
an evening with Mrs De Morgan & yourself on Tuesday the 24th? On that day we go to Town to remain till Friday, when we move down to Ashley for 2 months at least. I would endeavour to be early in Gower St; before eight or not later than eight. And I feel as if I should have
many mathematical things to discuss.
Now to my business :
1stly: I send you a paper marked 1, containing my
development of two Integrals in page 116, 􏰌√ dx =sin−1􏰊x−a􏰋
Ockham Park
Sunday. 15th Augst
[‘1841’ added by later reader]
 2ax−x2 a
And􏰌 √ dx =log(x+a+√2ax+x2)+log2
  2ax+x2
The former one I think is plain enough, & I and
 the book are quite agreed upon it. Not so with
[115v] the latter one, & I begin to suspect the book.
 I cannot make it anything but
 􏰌 √ dx 2ax+x2
orelse
=log(x+a+√2ax+x2) √
=log(x +a+ 2ax+x2)+log2 22
  I have tried various methods ; but the
only one which I find hold good [sic] at all, is
that applied in page 115 to 􏰌 √ dx , & which
 a2 +x2
my result above. By the bye I have a remark
seems clearly to bring out
to make on the Integration of 􏰌 √ dx as
 a2 +x2
developped [sic] in page 115.
Line 10 (from the bottom), you have xdx = ydy: This is obvious, & similarly I deduce in my paper No1,(2a+x)dx=ydy. ButIseenousein what follows, “and ydx + xdx = ydx + ydy”.
It is equally obvious with the former equation, but seems to me to have no purpose in bringing out the results, which I deduce as follows :
 
Since xdx = ydy, we have dx = dy yx
Therefore by the Theorem of page 48, or at least [‘by’ inserted] a Corollary of it, we have dx+dy = dx , whence &c, &c.
x+y y
And this is the method also which I have used
[116r] in developping [sic] 􏰌 √ dx . 2ax+x2
2ndly: Page 113, lines 16 [‘&c 17’ inserted] from the bottom, you say “The “first form becomes impossible when x is greater than
“√c, for in that case the Integral becomes the
“Logarithm of a Negative Quantity”. Now there are
surely certain cases in which negative quantities
may be powers, & therefore may have Logarithms.
All the odd whole numbers may surely be the
Logarithms of Negative Quantities.
(−a) × (−a) = a2 But (−a) × (−a) × (−a) = −a3
or (+a) × (+a) = a2 (+a) × (+a) × (+a) = a3
3 is here surely the Logarithm of a Negative Quantity.
Similarly a negative quantity multiplied into itself
any odd number of times will give a negative result.
3dly: In the Paper marked 3, which I return
again [‘for reference’ inserted] ; I perfectly understand the proof by means of the
Logarithms (added by you), why dy can only = y dx x
when y is either = x, or = ax (a being Constant) Your proof is perfect, but still I do not see that mine was not sufficient, tho’ derived from much more general grounds.
My argument was as follows : Given us dy = y , dx x
what conditions must be fulfilled in order
to make this equation possible? Firstly : I see that
[116v] since dy means a Differential Co-efficient, which dx
from it’s [sic] nature (being a Limit) is a constant & fixed thing, xy must also be a constant & fixed quantity. That is y must have to x a constant
Ratio which we may call a.
This seems to me perfectly valid. And surely a Differential Co-efficient is as fixed & invariable
in it’s [sic] nature as anything under the sun can be. To be sure you may say that there is a different Differential Co-efficient for every different initial value of x taken to start from, thus :
d(x2) =2x ifx=a, d(x2) =2a dx dx
               
if x = b, d(x2) = 2b dx
And this is perhaps what invalidates my argument above.
4thly: In the two papers folded together & marked 2, which I also again return for reference, I perfectly see that tho’ mathematically correct. I was completely wrong in my application. But my proofs do apply
to any two different & independent velocities, whatever of two different bodies, or of the same body moving
at two different uniform ratio [sic] at different epochs.
Thus my paper (marked upon it 1st Paper) proves [117r] the following : that the Spaces moved over at two different times, in virtue of the Velocity acquired at
the end of each of those times, (the impelling cause
being supposed to cease at the end respectively of each
time fixed on), would be to each other as the
squares of the times fixed on. But I perfectly
see that this is quite a different & independent
consideration from that of the Space actually moved
over by a body impelled by an accelerating force,
& how wholly inapplicable my [‘former’ inserted] view of it was.
I have been especially studying this
subject of [something crossed out] Accelerating Force, & believe that I now understand
it very completely. I found I could not rest upon
it at all, until I made the whole of the subject out
entirely to my satisfaction : I enclose you (marked
4) the first of a Series of papers I am making out
in the different parts [‘of’ inserted] it. This one is the more
general development of the particular case of Gravitation
in pages 27, 28 ; & my more especial object in it
has been the identification of the results arrived at
in this real application, with the Mathematical
Differential Co-efficient.
I have worked most earnestly & incessantly at the
Application of the Differential & Integral Calculus to the
[117v] subject of Accelerating Force, & Accelerated Motion,
during the last 2 or 3 weeks. It has interested me
beyond everything. After making out (according to
my own notions) the two papers on v = ds , and 􏰌 dt
s = vdt, (the first of which I now send, & the Second you will have in a day or two), I attacked your Chapter 8, pages 144, 145, worked out all the
                        
Formulae there ; & had excessive trouble with my third paper on t = 􏰌 ds , (now successfully terminated);
v
and I am now on f = dv , page 146. dt
You will perhaps not approve my having thus run
a little riot, & anticipated. But I think it has
done me great good. And I am anxious to know
if I may read the rest of this Chapter 8, before reading Chapter 7 on Trigonometrical Analysis ; & if I am likely to understand it all without having
read Chapter 7.
I shall probably write again tomorrow ; or if not,
certainly I shall on Tuesdy.
We are very anxious to know if there is no time
between the 1st Novr & the middle of Feby, when you &
Mrs De Morgan (& family) would come & stay here
for as long as you can & would like. We should
be delighted if you would remain 2 or 3 weeks.
[118r] And if this should be impossible for you, perhaps still you would bring Mrs De Morgan & the children here,
& remain a few days ; having them to stay longer.
We both of us assure you that it would be
no inconvenience whatever to us ; but rather contrary the greatest pleasure. And I am certain it
would do Mrs De Morgan good to be here for
a time. Pray consider my proposal ;
at any rate for her & the children, if your own avocations should make it impossible for you even. Believe me

Or if y2 = φx.x, then dy2 = x.d.φx + φx.dx
or d(y2)dy=x.d.φx+φx.dx dy
or 2ydy = x.d.φx + φx.dx, and ydy = 12 x.d.φx + 12 φx.dx [121v] This is all now right in my head.
    In 􏰌 √ dx
􏰌 2ax+x
2
we arrive then in my corrected paper,
√
  at √ dx =log(x+a+ 2ax+x2)
 2ax+x2 √ = log􏰑x + a +
2ax+x2 􏰒+log2 222
 which, as you observe “again with the book all but “the log .2, which being a Constant, matters nothing”. Very true ; but why did you then insist the
log 2 in page 116? it seems as if put in on purpose
to be effaced in the parenthesis (Omit the Constant). And it might just as well have been log 3,
log 4, log (anything in the world).
As to my two papers marked 2 (& which I
again return, merely for the convenience of reference),
I see that in order to make them valid, as applying
each to two separate & different velocities, they should
be re-written (which is not worth while), & the
terms of the enunications altered as follows :
“If two quantities V , V ′ be respectively equal to the
     “Ratios S, S′,andifV :V′ =T :T′,thenthevalues TT′
“S, S′ must be to each other as the squares of T, T′
  
“are to one another” &c, &c
[122r] At last I believe I have it quite correctly.
As for dy = y, I see my fallacy about y being dxx x
a fixed quantity.
 About page 113, “The first form becomes impossible
“when x is greater than √c, for &c”, I fancy I
  [something crossed out] had a little misunderstood
the mathematical meaning of the words impossible
quantity. I have loosely interpreted it as being
equivalent to “an absurdity”, or at least to
“an absurdity, unless an extension be made in the
“ordinary meaning of words”. And in this
instance I perceived that if the Logarithm be
an odd number, there would be no absurdity
even without extension in the meaning of terms ;
because that it would then merely imply a
negative Base ; which negative Base, would I think
be admitted theoretically (tho’ inconvenient practically)
on the common beginner’s instruction on the Theory of
                Logarithms. Am I right?
By the bye this subject reminds me that I think
I find a mistake in page 117, line 13 (from the top)
“(n an integer) 􏰌+a xndx = 0 when n is odd, = 2an+1 −a n+1
[122v] It seems to me just the reverse, thus : =0whenniseven,=2an+1 whennisodd
when n is even”
   n+1
􏰌 +a xndx = an+1 − (−a)n+1 = an+1−(−a)n+1 =
  I have it as follows :
  −a
n+1
= an+1−an+1
n+1
n+1 n+1
or 0 if n+1 be even
 (I now see it while working ; for if n+1 be even, n must be odd.)
 and vice versa. So I need not trouble you upon this ; as I have
solved my difficulty whilst stating it. I had only
looked at this Integral in [‘a’ inserted] great hurry, this morning.
I hope on Sunday to send you two remaining papers I have to make out, on the Accelerating Force subject ;
upon f = dv, and v = 􏰌 fdt dt
I think I have been encouraged by your great kindness, so as to give you really no Sinecure just at this moment.

Yours most truly A. A. Lovelace

9th Sepr [‘1841’ added by later reader]
Dear Mr De Morgan. I have rather a large batch
now for you altogether :
1stly: I am in the middle of the article on Negative & Impossible Quantities ; & I have a question to put on
page 134, (Second Column, lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 from the bottom)
(a+bk)m+nk =εAcosB+kεA.sinB&c
I have tried a little to demonstrate this Formula ;
but before I proceed further in spending more time
upon it, I think I may as well ask if it is intended
to be demonstrable by the Student. For you know I
sometimes try to do more than anyone means me to
attempt. I have as yet only got thus far [something crossed] with the above formula : If in (a + bk)m+nk, risgiven=√a2+b2,[‘and’inserted]tanθ=ab ;thensinθ=b
cos θ = a
and(a+bk)m+nk =(cosθ+k.sinθ)m+nk =
= (εkθ)m+nk = εk(mθ) × 􏰕εk(nθ)􏰖k
or = (cos .mθ + k. sin .mθ) × (cos .nθ + k. sin .mθ)k, and [123v] I dare say that from some of these transformations, the Second Side of the given equation, with the determination of A and B, may be deduced. But
it appears to me [‘it must be’ inserted] a very complicated process ; & therefore I should like to know before I undertook it,
that I was not wasting time [‘in’ deleted] doing so.
2dly: I am plagued over page 135 of the Calculus.
It is not that there is any one thing in it which
I do not clearly see. But it is the depth of the
whole argument which I cannot manage to discover.
I should say that whole argument from “We now know &c” page 134, to “We can therefore take a function,
“which, for a particular value of x, &c, &c” page 135.
It seems to me all to be much ado about nothing;
and I do not see what is arrived at by means
of it [something crossed out]. A very complicated process appears to be used in the 1st Paragraph of page 135, to prove
that when h is small then the Increment in φx
is very nearly represented by φ′a + h, which was
             
already shown in page 134. And then suddenly in the Second Paragraph the Formula φa + φ′a(x − a)+
+φ′′a(x−a)2 is introduced, & I do not understand 2
a` quoi bon the closing conclusion drawn from it. 3dly: I am not sure that I agree to what you
say in preference (for ascertaining Maxima & Minima) of the direct ascertainment of the value of φ′x, over [124r] the ordinary method. Because it seems to me in many cases impossible after you have determined 0 or
α values of φ′x, to determine further that the sign
does change at them & how it changes, unless by means of the ordinary rule. I have written out and
enclose an example from Peacock, in which unless I had used the ordinary rule, after I had determined 0 values for φ′x, I should have been at my wits’ end how to bring out the conclusion.
4thly: I send you a little Maxima & Minima
Theorem of my own, which occurred to me by accident ; Itisforφx=x2 −mx. Afterprovingitbythe
Differential Calculus, I have given a direct proof
of another sort. I merely wrote this [‘direct proof’ inserted], because it [something crossed out] occurred to me ; but it gave me a great deal of trouble, & I think was rather a work of supererogation;
but I believe it is quite correct. You will find
enclosed in the same sheet the demonstration of
“What is the number whose excess above it’s [sic] Square
“Root is the least possible?” (see page 133 of the Calculus) ;
and on the reverse side of this latter [something crossed out]
is the “verification round the 4 Right Angles” for the
continual increase together of x and it’s [sic] tangent (See
page 132). But here I have something further to
add. In this Chapter VIII, we hear of Differential
Co-efficient which become = 0, or = α. In this very
[124v] instance, 1 + tan2 x is alternately = 1, and = α.
Now according to my previous ideas, the terms
Differential Co-efficient was only applied to some
finite quantity ; and referring to pages 47, 48,
where one acquired one’s first ideas of a Differential
Co-efficient, I think it is there clearly explained
that the term is only used with reference to a
finite limit. But in this Chapter VIII, there
seems to be a considerable extension of meaning on
                    
the subject.
5thly. In page 132, it is very clearly deduced that
the Ratio of a [something crossed out] Logarithm to it’s [sic] number is increasing as long as x is < ε, and afterwards decreases.
The proof is most obvious. But, unluckily, the conclusion seems to me to be contrary to the fact ; at least the first half of the conclusion, not the latter half.
On this principle : from the very nature of a Logarithm, it is obvious that (x being > ε), for equal increments to the log, x, there will be
larger & larger Increments to x. The one being in arithmetical, the other in geometrical progression. Therefore clearly the Ratio of the Logarithm to the number, is a diminishing one. But then the
same thing seems to me to apply [something crossed out] when x < ε. Surely there is then just the same
[125r] arithmetical & geometrical progression for equal Increments of the Logarithms. I suppose there is
some link that I have over-looked.
I send you two Integrations worked out. They
are from Peacock. I in vain spent hours over the
one marked 2, of which I could make nothing by
any method that I devised ; until in despair, I
looked thro’ your Chapter XIII to see if I could there find any hints ; & accordingly at page 277, I
found a general formula which included this
case. But I do not believe I should ever have
hit upon it by myself. The Integral marked 1,
might of course be proved also in the same way ;
tho’ [‘my’ crossed out] the method [‘I have used’ inserted] is sufficient in this instance.
I have written out no more papers on
Forces. In fact there is only one more that is
left for me, viz: f = vdv. And for this I see ds
no occasion ; for I am sure that I must thoro’ly
understand it, after all I have written.
I quite see [‘the truth’ inserted] your remarks on my having treated Acceleration of Velocity as being identical with
Force ; whereas, (as I now understand it), it is
simply the measure of Force, & our only way of
getting at expressions for this latter. On the subject
[125v]ofv2 =2􏰌fds+C;Ihaveconsidereditagreat deal ; and any direct demonstration of it, after the
                      
manner of my other papers, seems to me to be quite impracticable. Neither 􏰌 v.dv, nor 􏰌 f.ds
[something crossed out] now appear to me to have any actual proto-types in the real motion. Here then suggests itself to me the
question : “then are there certain truths & conclusions
“which can be arrived at by pure analysis, & in
“no other way?” And also, how far abstract analytical expressions must express & mean something real, or not. In short, it has
suggested to me a good deal of enquiry, which
I am desirous of being put in the way of
satisfying.
By the bye, I fear that one little paper of mine
dropped out of the last packet. It was a little
pencil memorandum on [‘the meaning of’ inserted] 􏰌 f.ds ; & there were remarks upon it, (if you remember) in my accompanying
letter. It bears upon the above question.
I could write it out again, if it has been lost.
Is not this a budget indeed?
Yours most truly
A. A. Lovelace

Sunday. 19th Sepr [‘1841’ added by later reader]
Dear Mr De Morgan. I have more to say to you
than ever ; ( beginning with many thanks for your bountiful replies to my last packet).
I will begin with the Article on Negative & Impossible Quantities, on which I have a good deal to remark.
I have finished it ; & I think with on the whole
great success. I need scarcely say that I like it parenthetically. I enclose you the demonstration of the formula (a + bk)m+nk = εA. cos B + k.εA. sin B, which I found exceedingly easy, after your observations.
I should tell you that the allusions to the
Irreducible Case of Cubic Equations in this Article,
has so excited my curiosity on the subject, that I
have attacked the chapter on Cubic Equations in [‘page 47’ inserted] of R. Murphy’s treatise on the Theory of Equations (Library
Useful Knowledge), hoping there to gain some light
on the subject. For I know not to what exactly this
alluded, (my Algebra wits, as you say, not having
been quite proportionally stretched with some of my other
wits). I have got thro’ the first two pages ; and
[127v] shall have to write you some remarks upon these,
either in this letter, or in one as soon as possible.
But as yet I meet with nothing about
I hope I shall be able to understand the rest of the
Chapter.
At the bottom of my demonstration of (a + bk)m+nk, you
will find a memorandum (simple as to the working
out) of the formula cos .(a + bk), see page 137 of the
Cyclopedia. You there say that such a formula
may be interpreted by it’s [sic] identical expression on the
Second Side. That is to say I imagine that the
   √3 (a+b√−1)+√3 (a−b√−1)
    meaning of cos(a + b
√
−1), which (as before pointed out in
the case of the line h) is a misapplication of symbols,
may be got at thro’ an examination of the results
arrived at by [‘the application of’ inserted] symbolical rules to this unmeaning
or mis-meaning expression. That if in a calculation,
such an answer as cos(a + b the answer means in fact
√
−1) were worked out,

[something crossed out]
the remaining side of a parallelogram in which
cosαεb+ε−b is a diagonal, and sinα.εb−ε−b .k the 22
other side : the diagonal itself being a 4th Proportional
to 1, cosα, εb+ε−b , inclined to 1 [‘(that is to the Unit-Line)’ inserted] as the cosα is ; &
 2
the remaining side being a 4th Proportional to 1, sin α,
  εb−ε−b inclined to 1 at an angle equal to the sum of a 2
[128r] Right-Angle and the angle made by sin .α with the Unit-Line. I enclose you an explanation I
have written out (according to the Definition of this Geometrical Algebra), of the two formulae for the Sine and Cosine. I am at work now on the Trigonometrical Chapters of the Differential Calculus.
I do not agree to what is said in page 119 [‘(of the Calculus)’ inserted] that
results would be the same whether we worked [something crossed out] algebraically
 with forms expressive of quantities or not. It is true
that [‘in’ inserted] the form a + √m − √n, if (−1 be substituted for
 m and n, the results come out the same as if we
work with a only. but were the form a + √m,
a−√m, a×√m, or fifty others one can thin of,
surely the substitution of (−1) for m will not bring
out results the same as if we worked with a only;
and in fact can only do so when the impossible
expression is so introduced as to neutralize itself,
if I may so speak. I think I have explained
myself clearly.
It cannot help striking me that this extension of
Algebra ought to lead to a further extension
similar in nature, to Geometry in Three-Dimensions ;
& that again perhaps to a further extension into
some unknown region, & so on ad-infinitum possibly.
And that it is especially the consideration of
    √
−1, which should lead to this ; a symbol,
an angle =
which when it appears, sees to me in no way more
[128v] satisfactorily accounted for & explained than was
formerly the appearances [‘which’ inserted] Bombelli in some degree cleared up by showing that at any rate they
(tho’ in themselves unintelligible) led to intelligible
& true results. You do hint in parts of page 136
at the possibility of something of this sort.
  
I enclose you also a paper I have
written explaining a difficulty of mine in the Definitions of this Geometrical Algebra.
It appears to me that there is
no getting on at all without this Algebra. In
the 3d Chapter of your Trigonometry (which I have just been going thro’), though there are no impossible quantities introduced ; yet how unintelligible are
such formulae as 2ac. cos B, a. sin B, or any
in short where lines are multiplied into lines, if
one only takes the common notion of a line into a line being a Rectangle.
I cannot send more today ; but I have many other matters to write on ; especially the Logarithmic Theory at the end of the Article.
I am considering it very carefully ; & studying
at the same time the Article on Logarithms in the Cyclopedia. And I believe I shall have much to say on it all.
The passage I wanted to ask you about in Lam ́e’s
[129r] 1st Vol, is pages 54, 55, 56, on the Resultant of the pressures of a liquid on a vase. I want to know
if I ought to understand these three pages, or if they entail some knowledge of mathematical (especially of trigonometrical) application to Mechanics, which I
do not yet possess.
I hope you receive game regularly. Yours most truly
A. A. Lovelace
P.S. Did you ever hear of a Science called Descriptive Geometry? I think Monge is the
originator of it.
             
[130r] Dear Mr de Morgan I have for the last
fortnight [‘been’ inserted] daily intending to write to you on mathematical
matters ; & now I do not
think it worth while because
I have an idea of being in
Town on Tuesdy next for a
day or two. And if could
see you on Weddy, either by
your kindly coming to me
[130v] at 12 o’clock that day, or by my going to spend Weddy
Evg in Gower St, it
would answer the purpose much
better. Besides having a
list of [‘particular,’ inserted] little things to ask you about ; I am now anxious
to consult you again as to
my general progress & way of
going on. I have one or
two little difficulties just now.
I believe we shall
remain on here for some
weeks longer. My intended journey to Town is only on particular business. And by the bye it is not to be known
that I am going. My mother [131r] even has no idea of it ; & I do not wish that she should.
So I will thank you & Mrs
De Morgan to mention nothing about it to any one.
How is she? And when to
be confined?

Dear Mr De Morgan. As I find my journey to
Town is extremely uncertain, & may possibly even not take place at all, I will trouble you without
further delay on the more important of my present points of difficulty.
I will begin with those relating to Chapter 9th of the Calculus, which I am now studying. I have arrived
at page 156.
page 132 : (at the bottom). I make u = cos−1 􏰑1−ε2(C−x) 􏰒 ε2(C −x) +1
instead of u = cos−1 􏰑ε2(C−x)−1􏰒 ε2(C −x) +1
I enclose a paper with my version of it.
page 153 : “For instance, we should not recommend
“the student to write the preceding thus, d2.du + d2x.du = 0, “tho’ is it certainly true that upon the implicit
“suppositions with regard to the successive Increments, “∆2u.∆x + ∆2x.∆u diminishes without limit as compared “with (∆x)3.” Why this comparison with (∆x)3?
[132v] Had the expression been ∆2u.∆x+∆2x.∆u instead (∆x)3
of ∆2u.∆x + ∆2x.∆u, it would then be clear that if
the Numerator diminished without limit with respect
to the Denominator, the fraction itself would approach without limit to 0. But as it is, I see no purpose answered by a comparison with (∆x)3.
Also, I not only do not see the object of this comparison,
but I do not perceive the fact itself either. Where is the proof that ∆2u.∆x + ∆2x.∆u does
diminish without limit with respect to (∆x)3?
Page 135 : (at the top) : There is a slight misprint
C=K2+K12 insteadofC=K2+K′2
Page156: (line9fromthetop): u=C.sinθ+C′.cosθ+21θ.sinθ
            (Explain this step?)
(1). . . u = C sin θ + C′ cos θ + 21 θ. sin θ + 14 cos θ (quite clear)
(2)...Andu=cosθ−d2u (byhypothesis) dθ2
 Now I cannot “explain this step”. In the previous line, we have :
 
= 1 cos θ + 􏰑 3 cos θ − d2 u 􏰒 4 4 dθ2
whence one may conclude that
C. sin θ + C′ cos θ + 1 θ. sin θ = 3 cos θ − du
2 4 dθ2 But how u = C sinθ + C′ cosθ + sinθ.12θ is to be deduced
[133r] I do not discover : By subtracting 41 cos θ from both sides of (1), we get
u−41 cosθ=Csinθ+C′.cosθ+21θ.sinθ But unless 14 cos θ = 0, (which would only be the case
I conceive if θ = w2 ), I do not see how to derive
the equation in line 9 of the book.
Page156: Showthat d2u −u=X (afunctionofx) dx2
I have,

Then du = Kεx + K′ε−x, and d2u = Kεx + K′ε−x+

[133v] But I do not see how to get these two latter equations co-existent.
I enclose an attempt of mine, making the assumed
to be dK εx + dK′ ε−x = x2 instead of = 0 ;
dx dx
and also [‘one’ inserted] making this relation to be K + K′ = x3, but which latter I found led to such very complicated
results that I proceeded but a little way, thinking
it a probable loss of time to go on.
With the relationship dK εx + dK′ ε−x = x2, I am dx dx
as unsuccessful as with = 0.
I defer to another letter some other difficulties of mine not relating to this Chapter, but partly to
some remaining points in the 8th Chapter, & partly to miscellaneous matters.
  
I hope Mrs De Morgan & the “large boy” continue to flourish. So Mrs De M has beat the Queen in
the race, out & out!

Monday. 8th Novr [‘1841’ added by later reader]
Dear Mr De Morgan. I hope you intend to christen
the “large boy” by the name of Podge, with which I
am particularly pleased.
I am much obliged by your letter. I send a corrected
version (now I believe quite right) of d2u − u = X; on my dx2
assumed supposition dK εx + dK′ ε−x = 0. As for my other dx dx
assumption K + K′ = x3, it is so complicated a one that I
have not thought it worth while to pursue it’s [sic] development.
I cannot think how I could be so negligent as to
forget that ε−x is a function of (−x) which is itself a
function of x. A complete oversight ; as indeed most
of the enquiries in my last letter seem to have been.
I should perhaps mention that lately [something crossed out] I have
had my mind a good deal distracted by some
circumstances of considerable annoyance & anxiety to
me ; & I have certainly studied much less well &
more negligently in consequence. Indeed the last few
weeks I have not at all got on as I wished and
intended ; & I find that to force myself, (when
[134v] disinclined & distraite), beyond a certain point is
very disadvantageous. So on these occasions I just
keep gently going, without however attempting very
much. I am hoping now to get a good lift again
before long ; as I think I am returning to a more
settled & concentrated state of mind. I mention all
this as an excuse for some errors & over-sights which
I conceive are more likely just at present to creep
into my performances than would usually be the
case. Now to business : Chapter VIII :
1. I send you two Problems on hypotheses of my own,
intended as being worked out on the model of those
in page 150. There are three different Hypotheses.
IntheonewhereIobtaint=√1 􏰌 √ ds Ihave 2 s−1 −a−1
not attempted to develop this Integral further.
Perhaps I ought to have done so ; but it was only my object to get quite a general expression.
2. Page 141 ; (lines 9, 10, from the bottom) : Series in page
116 (of Chapter VI), it was shown that 􏰌 √ ds = sin−1 x−k = 2kx−x2 x
               
=􏰊vsin−1 x􏰋+􏰊w􏰋,Idonotseehowitcanbesaid(page141) k2
that the Constant may have any value P .
3. I have never succeeded in properly understanding
the Paragraph beginning page 134, ending page 135, on
which I before applied to you ; & the paragraph of
page 148 – (marked 2) – has only added to my mistiness on [135r] the subject. There is something or other which I cannot get at in the argument & it’s [sic] objects. That of page
135 seems very like another way of arriving at
Taylor’s Theorem. The expression taken in line 25 from
the top, I conclude to be arrived at as follows :
Having obtained φa + φ′a.(x − a) ; a function agreeing
in value and diff-co with φx when x = a, let us now
find a function agreeing not only in these two points
but also in second diff-co with φx, when x = a ;
(the same conditions being continued of φ′a, φ′′a) ;
We see therefore that φ′a must be of the form
φ′′a.x + m where m = φ′a − φ′′a.a Substituting this in φa + φ′a.(x − a) we have
φa + (φ′′a.x + m)(x − a) = φa + (φ′′a.x − a + φ′a)(x − a) = φa + φ′a.(x − a) + φ′′a(x − a)2
Similarly we may obtain φa + φ′a.(x − a) + φ′′a.(x − a)2 + φ′′′a.(x − a)3 (By the bye I don’t see how you get (x−a)2 and (x−a)3 , instead
    of (x−a)2 and (x−a)3 as I make it).
But I cannot perceive what all this is for ; & (as
I mentioned below), paragraph 2 of page 148 has added to my blindness. I am sorry to plague you again about it. On receiving your former reply, I felt none the wiser ; but determined to wait, thinking I
might see it as I went on, which is often the case
[135v] with difficulties.
I now proceed to some miscellaneous matters.
1. I make nothing of the Irreducible Case in the
Penny Cyclopedia. Is it perhaps for want of having read Involution & Evolution? I am puzzled quite
in the beginning of the Article.
2. Article “Negative & Impossible Quantities” P. Cyclopedia – page 137 “If the logarithm of two Units inclined at angles θ and θ′ be
added, (the bases being inclined at angles φ and φ′) ; the result
is the logarithm of a Unit inclined &c, &c”
I cannot develop this ; but I enclose some remarks upon it.
3. In the treatise you sent me on the “Foundation of Algebra”,
2
2.3
       
I cannot make out [‘in’ inserted] the least [something crossed out] (page 5), about the general
solution of φ2x = ax. I suspect I do not understand
the notation f−1x. I quite understand f2x or φ2x,
fnx or φnx. Judging by analogy, from page 82 of the Differential & Integral Calculus, (where ∆−1x is explained),
I conceive f−1x or φ−1x may mean “the quantity “which having had an operation f or φ performed
“with & upon it, is = x.” But I have considered much over the last half of this page 5, & I can’t understand it.
I have one or two other matters still to write about ; but they do not press ; & this is plenty I think for today. Pray congratulate Mrs De Morgan on the arrival & prosperity of Podge.

Dear Mr De Morgan. In consequence of a
sudden decision that I must
go to Town tomorrow, I write without delay to beg for a
line in St James’ Sqre, if
you will kindly fix any
hour on Satdy between nine
& three o’clock, that may be most convenient to you to
call on me there. I am
[136v] very anxious to see you ; & hope it may not be very inconvenient to you.
I had not the least idea
till an hour ago, that I
should go to Town this week. It is in consequence of letters unexpectedly received.
I will just again mention
that I do not wish my
journey to be known ; & I
have told no one except those necessarily concerned.
In much haste
Yours most truly A. A. Lovelace

Dear Mr De Morgan. What
will you say when I write
word that my intended
journey is again delayed? & cannot now take place before Sunday or Monday week. I
fear you will never trust me again ; but I must beg to assure you that this uncertainty has been quite unavoidable.
Everything was arranged
last night for our setting out
at six this morning ; when
[138v] unexpected circumstances obliged
us to delay once more [‘fulfilling’ inserted] our intentions. I shall really feel
quite ashamed next time, to
write to you on a similar
appointment ; altho’ I do not
think it is possible that
another put-off should occur.
May I hope meanwhile
to receive a reply to my last letter of Monday.
I am going on very well
indeed I believe now, with
my studies ; next week I expect a few interruptions however from some engagements I have made.
With many apologies, pray [139r] believe me
Yours most truly A. A. Lovelace
  
[140r] My Dear Mr De Morgan. I am to be in Town
(for as certain as any human
affairs can be), next week.
May I hope to see you on
Tuesday ; any hour you like
[‘to fix’ inserted] between 12 & 4 o’clock?
Thanks for yesterday’s packet. I shall probably
send you a Budget in a
day or two again ; as it
will save time when I see [140v] you. For I have so many Memoranda down to ask about, that it will be
best all the principal
things should just be
noted to you first.
Then we shall know at once where & what to begin upon.
I am in the middle of Operation ; indeed nearly thro’ it ; & find no difficulties scarcely ; at least none of any moment.
I see I have made a bother of u = Cεx + C′ε−x+
+12εx 􏰌 ε−xXdx − 12ε−x 􏰌 εxXdx [141r] ; not from any mis-comprehension of it ; but from too much
haste in writing out. As

Mr Dear Mr De Morgan. [something crossed out] I said Weddy. At least I
meant to do so. On Tuesday I have already an engagement in the morning. Perhaps you have written Tuesday by mistake. But of you cannot come on Weddy, then I must put off my Tuesday’s engagement, that I may see you then. If it is the same to you however, I should much prefer Weddy.
Can you kindly give me one line tomorrow to
say which it is to be. I shall get [‘it’ inserted] in the evening in St James’ Sqre. Now I proceed to business :
1stly: You have mistaken my intentions I think about
the formulae of pages 155, 156. My enclosures 1 & 2
will explain.
2ndly. Enclosure 3 contains the demonstration of “Exercise”
page 159 3dly.Enclosure4 . . . . . . . . . . “Exercise”
page 158
4thly: About the Constant in page 141 : I still am
[142v] unsatisfied. I perfectly understand that “any value” consists with everything in page 141. The principle
is I conceive exactly the same as that by which in
page 149, y is made = a + sin .x instead of y = sin x.
I only mean that this result seems inconsistent with page 116 when it is shown that the Constant
must = w2 .
5thly: page 161, (line 14 from the top):
φ′′(x + θh, y + k) − φ′′(x + θh, y) = φ(′′)(x + θh, y + vk).k 1
         Why is v introduced at all?
I have as follows :
φ′′(x+θh,y+k)−φ′′(x+θh,y) =φ(′′)(x+θh,y)
k1
if k diminishes without limit ; (k being = ∆y)
or φ′′(x + θh, y + k) − φ′′(x + θh, y) = φ(′′)(x + θh, y)k 1
But I do not see how v comes in.
6thly : I have several remarks to make altogether on the Article Operation. I will only now subjoin two. I believe on the whole that I understand the
v<1
   
Article very well.
See page 443, at the top, (2nd Column) :
φ2 + 2φψ + ψ2, or (x2)2 + 2(x3)2 + (x3)3
should be it appears to me φ2 + 2φψ + ψ2, or (x2)2 + 2x3.x3 + (x3)2
or (x2)2 + 2(x3)2 + (x3)2 = (x2)2 + 3(x3)2
[143r] I only allude to (x3)3, instead of (x3)2 as I make it. See page 444, at the bottom, (2nd column) :
“Where B0, B1, &c are the values of fy and its “successive diff-co’s [sic] when y = 0, &c, &c”
Surely it should be when y = 1.
The same as when immediately afterwards, (see page
445, 1st column, at the top), in developping [sic] (2 + ∆)−1φx; B0, B1 &c are the values of fy & its Co-efficients
when y = 2, &c, &c.
I have referred to Numbers of Bernoulli
& to Differences of Nothing ; in consequence of reading this Article Operation. And find that
I must read that on Series also.
I left off at page 165 of the Calculus ; &
suppose that I may now resume it ; (when I return here that is).
I will not trouble you further in this letter.
But I have a formidable list of small matters down, against I see you.
Yours most sincerely A. A. Lovelace

[‘1842’ added by later reader]
Dear Mr De Morgan. I am going on well ; [‘quite’ inserted] as I could wish. I have done much since I saw you ;
& you will have all the results of the last few days
in good time. I enclose you now two papers ; one
on f = dv, the other on 􏰌a′ f.dt. dt a
You will have next those on vdv = f, and 2􏰌 dt
v =2 f.ds+C. ThislatterIthinkIhave
succeeded in analysing to my mind.
I have [‘now’ inserted] two observations to make : [something crossed out]
1stly: I think I have detected a slight error in one
of my former papers, that on t = 􏰌 ds. I return v
it for reference. In order in the [something crossed out] Summation [something crossed out]
􏰗1 + 1 +···· 1 􏰘ds,toendwith 1 , φs φ(s+ds) φ(2s) φ(2s)
I should have begun with 1 not with 1 . φ(s+ds) φs
If the time elapsed during the first fraction of Space
[144v] (starting from s) were [‘made’ inserted] = 1 , then the time for the last
φs
   of the Fractions necessary to complete up to 2s, would be 1 , and not 1 which it ought to be.
 φ(2s−ds φ(2s)
I don’t know that this affects the correctness of the
 ultimate limit of the Summation. But here, where the Summation itself is made to represent a hypothetical movement, it is clearly wrong.
The error is avoided in the former paper I had written on s = 􏰌 v.dt, which I likewise return to refer to this Point.
2ndly: In considering a priori the Integral 􏰌 f.ds,
I am inclined still to adhere to my original
opinion (expressed in the pencil Memorandum I showed
you & [‘which I’ inserted] now return). I should premise that I now mention this merely as a curious subject of investigation,
not because it is concerned in the [something crossed out] papers I ammakingoutuponv2 =2􏰌f.ds+C,inwhichI
have avoided the direct consideration of 􏰌 a′ f.ds. a
   
I am disposed to contend that tho’ ds
does here represent Space, that still the ds fraction
of any one of the terms of the Summation, say φ(a + n.ds)ds
means the same fraction of φ(a + n.ds) which ds is of
[145r] a Unit of Space ; & therefore that since φ(a + n.ds)
represents Force, (or [‘uniform’ inserted] Acceleration of Velocity for 1 Second
in operation during the performance of the length ds),
the ds fraction of this expression must represent the
[‘ds part of this Force or the’ inserted] actual Acceleration for 1 of a Second. I treat ds
ds
as
an abstract quantity. And so I conceive [something crossed out] dt must
betreatedins=􏰌v.dt,[‘ds’inserted]int=􏰌 ds,dtin􏰌f.dt,
v
&c, &c.
I should tell you that I am much pleased with
the observation you added to my inverse demonstration
of 􏰌 fx.dxdt = 􏰌 fx.dx , and that I quite dt
understand [‘why’ inserted] my proof can only be admissible on the Infinitesimal Leibnitzian Theory. But this
theory is to my mind the only intelligible or
satisfactory one. In fact, (notwithstanding it’s [sic] error),
I should call it the only true one.
By and bye, you will have some observations
of mine upon Differential Co-efficients & Integrals, abstractly considered. I have been thinking much
upon them.
I am going on with Chapter VIII.
By the bye, I believe you will receive somehow tomorrow [145v] a book (the 1st Vol of Lam ́e’s Cours de Physique) in which there is a passage which I will write
to you about as soon as I find time.
I forgot to mention it to you on Thursday ; &
so have ordered the Book to be sent to you, that
I might write about it sometime.
Believe me
Yours very truly

[‘1842’ or ‘1847’ added by later reader]
[I think this might date from earlier than 1842, as it contains material that seems to fit
better with the earlier letters — I’ll try to slot it in]
Dear Mr De Morgan. I am very much obliged
for your long letter. The Formula in Peacock
comes out quite correct now that I have writtendiff.coof(b−x)4 =4(b−x)3×(−1)=−4(b−x)3. It is odd that notwithstanding the caution you
gave me in Town on this very point, I should have fallen into the trap. There is nothing like one’s own blunders after all for instruction.
I do not however understand why example (19) page 4, has not come out wrong also in
my working out. I enclose a copy of my
solution, and it appears to me it ought to
be wrong, because I surely should have had diff.coof(1−x)4 =4(1−x)3×(−1)=−4(1−x)3,whereas Ihavediff.coof(1−x)4 =4(1−x)3.
On looking over my development again very
carefully, I am inclined to think that my solution
[146v] (1+x)2 × (7 + x), comes out right only because (1−x)5
I have managed to make another blunder of a sign in the course of the proofs, which has corrected the first blunder. I therefore now write on the other side of the paper, what I think it should be.
The note in page 2 I do not imagine to be of
any consequence. It is on “rendering the Differentiation “of complicated Functions sometimes much easier” by means of three Theorems from Maclaurin’s Fluxions.
Certainly had I thought a little
more upon what I read some weeks ago, before
I wrote my last letter to you, I should not
have sent the question about du = φ(x) × dx [flourishes at tops of stems of ‘d’s, here and after].
I [‘must have’ inserted] forgot exactly what a Differential Co-efficient
means, when I did so. But how is it then
that in your 1st Chapter of the Differential Calculus”
there is no mention of the multiplication by dx?”
 
I conclude that the real Differential Co-efficient is du = φ(x), and that Peacock’s solutions are”
dx
not strictly speaking Differential Co-efficients. ”
I think pages 13 to 15 of your Elementary
[147r] Illustrations bear considerably upon the observations
in your letter, do they not?
Your explanation of Euler’s proof of the Binomial
Theorem is perfectly satisfactory to me. Unluckily
I have not any Book here which contains the
Theory of Combinations. I wanted to refer to
this when reading page 215, as I have forgotten
it in it’s [sic] particulars. However this can very
well wait a short time, & I have only to take
the Formula for Combinations for granted meanwhile. Thenecessityofthetruthof(1+x)n ×(1+x)m =(1+x)n+m for all values of n and m, since it is true
when they are whole numbers, I shall probably
see more clearly at some further time.
I can explain exactly what my
difficulty is in Chapter X. “For instance, if we “know that φ(xy) = x × φy, supposing this always “true, it is true when y = 1, which gives φ(x) = “= x × φ(1). But φ(1) is an independent quantity, “made by writing 1 instead of y in φ(y). Let us “call it c &c. ”
It is this substitution of 1 and of c, and
consequent ascertainment of the form which will [147v] satisfy the equation, which is all dark to me. It is ditto in lines 12, 13, & 14 from the top.
I understand quite well I believe from
“We have seen that if φx = cx &c”, all through the next page.
That I do not comprehend at all the means of deducing from a Functional Equation the form which will satisfy it, is I think clear from
my being quite unable to solve the example
at the end of the Chapter “Shew that the equation “φ(x + y) + φ(x − y) = 2φx × φy is satisfied
“by φx = 21 (ax + a−x)”. I have tried
several times, substituting first 1 for x, then
1 for y. but I can make nothing whatever
of it, and I think it is evident there is
   
something that has preceded, which I have not understood. The 2nd example given for practice “Shew that φ(x + y) = φx + φy can “have no other solution than φx = ax”, I have not attempted.
I have a question to ask upon page 229.
“By extracting a sufficiently high root of z, we [148r] “can bring zm as near to 1 as we please, or “make zm − 1 as small as we please ; that is “(page 187) zm − 1 may be made as nearly equal “to the sum of the whole series as we please”.
I cannot find what it is that is referred
to in page 187 ; and Secondly, it appears to me somewhat of a contradiction that a quantity zm − 1 which can certainly be made as small as we please by the diminution of m, should
become as near as we please to a fixed
limit or sum (the log z I conclude is the
sum of the series, referred to), since by continued diminution the quantity zm − 1 may become a great deal less than the sum of the Series, &
keep receding from it.
To return to Chapter X, there is one other
thing in it that I do not understand. Page
205, lines 5, 6, 7 from the bottom. It seems
to me fallacious to substitute first one value
0, for a letter ; & then another value, let y = −x, [148v] in the same equation & in a manner at the same time. How can the two suppositions
consist together at all.
I go on well with the Trigonometry, &
have nearly finished the Number & Magnitude. I think there is another Erratum in page
34 of the Trigonometry, line 13 from the bottom = OM · ON − NR · NP &c
ON OP NP NO
should be −NR · NP NP OP
I am really ashamed to send you such troublesome letters.

Ashley-Combe Novr 27th
Dear Mr De Morgan. I have I believe made
some little progress towards the comprehension of
the Chapter on Notation of Functions, & I enclose
you my Demonstration of one of the Exercises at
the end of it : “Show that the equation φ(x + y) =
“= φx + φy can be satisfied by no other solution
“than φx = ax.” At the same time I am
by no means satisfied that I do understand
these Functional Equations perfectly well, because
I am completely baffled by the other Exercise :
“Shew that the equation φ(x + y) + φ(x − y) =
“= 2φx × φy is satisfied by φx = 21 (ax + a−x)
“for every value of a”.
I do not know when I have been so tantalized
by anything, & should be ashamed to say how
much time I have spent upon it, in vain.
[149v] These Functional Equations are complete Will-o’- -the-Wisps to me. The moment I fancy I have
really at last got hold of something tangible
& substantial, it all recedes further & further
& vanishes again into thin air.
But now for this perplexing φx = 12 (ax + a−x).
I believe I have left no method untried ; but
I cannot get further than as below, with any
certainty :
φ(x + y) + φ(x − y) = 2φx × φy ∵ 2φx = φ(x+y)+φ(x−y)
φy
Since x and y may have any values whatever,
(at least such I conclude is of course intended), let
y = 0. We have then 2φx = φ(x)+φ(x)
φ(0)
∵ 2φx × φ(0) = φ(x) + φ(x)
or 2φx × φ(0) = 2φx
φ(0)must=1,or=a0,sincea0 is
the only function of 0 which can = 1
I think so far is correct in itself, but whether
[150r] it be the [‘right’ inserted] road to the rest is another question. At any rate, I have not succeeded in proving
  
it such. To assume that since φ(0) = a0,
φ(x + y) = ax+y, φ(x − y) = ax−y, φy = ay
appears to me scarcely warrantable ; and
besides in that case it must be equally
assumed that φx = ax, (there being the same
ground for the one assumption as for the others),
and we should then have,
ax = ax+y+ax−y ay
∵ax =ax+y +ax−y ay ay ∵ax =ax +ax−2y
most clearly absurd, independent of it’s [sic] being discordant with the book.
Once I thought I had hit on something very
clever indeed, and wrote as follows :
φ(x + y) = φ(x + y.1)
= {φ(1)}x+y by equation (φa)n = φ(na)
page 205, entirely forgetting that the φ of that equation had nothing whatever to do with the
φ of any other equations ; (a disagreeable truth [150v] which did not occur to me until 24 hours later). I then had φ(x − y) = φ(x − y.1) = {φ(1)}x−y
φ(y) = φ(y.1) = {φ(1)}y, and 2φx = {φ(1)}x+y+{φ(1)}x−y
{φ(1)}y
= {φ(1)}x+y + {φ(1)}x−y
{φ(1)}y {φ(1)}y
= {φ(1)}x + {φ(1)}x−2y, and supposing
x = y, then 2φx = {φ(1)}x + 21 {φ(1)}−x
or calling φ(1) = a, φx = 21 (ax + a−x)
But besides my unwarrantable assumption of
φ(x + y.1) = {φ(1)}x+y, there was this in the
result which was unsatisfactory, that it was necessary to assume x = y, and the result seemed
to hold good in that case alone. Also, when to verify, I tried x = 1, ∵ φ(1) = 21 (a1 + a−1),
which ought to have come out a = a, I could
make neither head or tail of it. Well, I
abandoned this, & tried all sorts of other resources. [151r] I understand to work out something by means similar to those in page 205 and in the
Problem I send ; but equally unsuccessfully.
I also in equation (A) page 204, changed
φ(x + y) into φ(x − y) and investigated this,
    
thinking I might derive a hint possibly from it.
[something crossed out] In short, many & various are the experiments I have made, but I will not detail any
more. Indeed I think you may be possibly
heartily sick of what I have detailed. But
I wished to show you that I have not failed
from want of trying, at least ; & also to give
you the chance of smiling at my expence [sic].
I shall have to trouble you with another
letter shortly, on other knotty points. Really I do not give you a Sinecure. Your letters are however well bestowed, in as far as the use
they are of to me, can make them so, and
the great encouragement that such assistance
is to me to continue my Studies with zeal
& spirit. We are to return to Surrey very
[151v] soon. I expect to have occasion to trouble you again before we go, & after that I shall hope to see you & Mrs De Morgan in Town, where I intend to be for two or three days
in about a fortnight.

Dear Mr De Morgan. I am indeed extremely
obliged to you for all your late communications.
In two or three days more, I shall have
several observations & to send you in reply
to some of them.
My object in writing today, is to make another enquiry concerning the substitution of φ1(a + h) − φ1a for φ(a + h) − φa in page 100, for I perceive
on carefully examining the passage, that I do
not quite understand it
φ1x = φx + C, which [‘last side’ inserted] means the Primitive Function [‘of φ′x’ inserted]
and the Primitive Function means the Function which differentiated gives φ′x
Therefore φ1(a + h) = φ(a + h) + C
And φ1a = φa + C
Consequently φ1(a + h) − φ1a = φ(a + h) + C − (φa + C)
= φ(a + h) − φa [152v] This is my version of it. But you tell me,
φ1(a + h) = φ(a + h) + C
φ1a = φa, (which ought to be I say
φ1a = φa + C) From which we should have,
φ1(a + h) − φ1a = φ(a + h) + C − φa Consequently φ1(a + h) − φ1a is not equal
to φ(a+h)−φa as is required to be proved, but is = φ(a + h) − φa + C.
I cannot unravel this at all.
Secondly: [something crossed out] I do not see why the Indefinite Integral only is = φx + C = Primitive Function.
of φ′x
The argument at the top of page 101 seems
to [something crossed out] me to apply equally to the Definite Integral
As follows : It is proved that
         
φ1(a + h) − φ1a = 􏰌 a+h φ′x.dx a
φ1a is just as much here an arbitrary Constant as it is in φ1x − φ1a = 􏰌 x φ′x.dx
a
Therefore 􏰌 a+h φ′x.dx = φ1(a + h) + C1 a
= φ(a + h) + C + C1
= φ(a + h) + an arbitrary Constant [153r] just as with φ1x − φ1a = 􏰌 x φ′x.dx
a
Thirdly : With respect [‘to’ inserted] the assumption that when
a is arbitrary, then any function of a, say φa,
is also arbitrary or may be anything we please,
seems to me not always valid.
For instance if φa = a0, it must be
always = 1. We may assume a = anything we
like, but φa will not in this case be
arbitrary.
It is curious how many little things I [something crossed out] discover in this Chapter, which in looking back upon
them, I find I have only half-understood.
I shall be exceedingly obliged, if you
can answer these points soon ; I think a
word almost may explain them, & they rather annoy me.
Believe me, with many thanks Yours very truly

Dear Mr De Morgan
It would give me
great pleasure to see you
again, & to have a chat
with you. If therefore I
am in Town on Tuesday
week, (which is likely), do
you think you could call
on me at 11 o’clock.
I should propose going to
[154v] Gower St to see Mrs De
Morgan, but on this
occasion I should not have
[something crossed out] time to go so far.
If therefore you
answer me affirmatively, I
shall not write again unless
I should be prevented from going.
I have been doing little
of late in Mathematics ;
just amusing myself
with Murphy’s Theory of Equations (in the Useful Knowledge) ; & looking into one or two other little
matters, rather than
[155r] studying them. So I have no very diligent reckoning
to make you.
My kind remembrances

 P. S. Excuse my materials.
Dear Mr De Morgan. In much haste, I write to tell you that I must adjourn
the proposed engagement for Monday next, until Monday week ; owing to an unforeseen obstacle for next Monday afternoon. You have very probably already written
to me ; & if so, I shall (to save you trouble) take it
for granted if I do not hear, [156v] that the hour fixed will be for the Monday week instead.
I was obliged to stay in
Town last night, unexpectedly; but am just setting out..
I was very glad to
find Mrs De Morgan so
well & cheerful, & moreover that she approved of a proposition I made her ; (not a proposition of our particular kind however).
I remain

Dear Mr De Morgan
In consequence of yr kind reply to my former note, Lord L think I had better send you the paper, (which has been put into type, tho’ not published).
Should you be at
leisure & disposed to
look at it, you will
at once see how much [157v] stuff there is in it, & of what a solid quality.
Some few corrections are wanting, before it finally goes to proofs.
There is also one single sentence, (I think in page 22), about Irish Priests & Douai, which must be altered or cut out, for a Roman Catholic Editor.
Much of the Paper, tho’ on so dry a subject, is amusing enough. If you [158r] look at it, & should discover my inaccuracies or anything which might be made clearer, pray
be kind enough to men= =tion it.
I will not now detain you further.

[159r] 10. St James’ Sqre Tuesdy Morning
12 past 12 o’clock
Dear Mr De Morgan. I
am most particularly vexed
& annoyed at finding
that you have just been
here, & are gone without
[‘my’ inserted] seeing you. Owing to the message received by
the carriage the other
day, I had reserved
this morning particularly
[159v] for our affairs, & I
cannot but think that
either my footman must
have blundered the
matter & sent you away,
or that there has been
some misunderstanding or
other. Your time is
so valuable that it is
without measure vexatious
you should have come all
the way here for nothing,
& when I was especially
waiting for you too.
[160r] Now it does so happen
quite by chance that I
have this evening at
liberty. May I come
to Gower St between eight
& nine therefore, & so
repair the mistake of
this morning? I am
quite in a fuss about
my mathematics, for I
am in much want of a
little lift at this
moment ; & you know
how I have my progress
[160v] at heart.
   
I write in a great
hurry ; & I only hope that such a contrariety will never happen again.
You must forgive my writing in such a fuss ;
but I cannot imagine
how the thing has happened. Believe me
Yours very truly A. A. Lovelace
 
[161r] Dear Mr De Morgan Yes tomorrow
morning between 12 past twelve & one o’clock will do. (Remember I write Tuesday Night).
I am much provoked
at my stupid servants’
stupid blunder, but I
[161v] believe the poor man
meant to be highly
discerning & well-judging.
I was at the moment
treating for an Opera
Box for [‘the night of’ inserted] Rachel’s Benefit, which I conclude the
footman thought a
much more important
matter than any
spectacles in the world
could [something crossed out] betoken. He is
a new man, & does not
know my people yet.
[162r] In haste
Yours most truly obliged A. Ada Lovelace
Tuesday Night
St James’ Sqre

[166r] Ockham Thursday
Many thanks for the packet
of yesterday morning. I shall
write in reply to it tomorrow. I send today
some Integral Developments (see pages 116, 117); &
another of the Accelerating Force papers.
Any hour you may appoint on Thursday Morning [something torn away] I will be ready. Shall I say 10 o’clock?

[168r] [In De Morgan’s hand] When an equation involves only two variables, it is easy enough to write all
differential equations so as to contain nothing
but differential coefficients; thus
y=logx dy =1 dx x
If we prefer to write dy = dx, it x
must be under a new understanding. By dy, we mean the limit of ∆y, not
dx ∆x
any value which ∆y ever can have, but
∆x
that which it constantly tends towards,
as ∆x is diminished without limit. But in dy = dx, we cannot by dy
x
and dx mean limits, for the limits are zeros; and 0 = x0 , though very true, is unmeaning
What then do we mean by this When y = log x , dy = dx
x
we mean that ∆y = ∆x , as ∆x diminishes x
without limit, not only diminishes without limit, but diminishes without limit as compared with ∆x or ∆y. So that, if we call it a, or if
[168v]∆y−∆x =a x
Then a is useless, and we might as
well write 0. For since the processes of the differential calculus always terminate
in taking limits of ratios and since ∆y − 1 = a
∆x x ∆a
(or some transformation of this sort) must come at last, our limiting equation
must be
dy−1=Limitofa =0 dxx ∆x
The truth of every equation differentially written, as dy = p dx, is always absolutely speaking, only approximate: but the approximation is relatively
closer and closer . Understand it as if it were
dy = (p+λ)dx
where λ diminishes with dx, so that
the error made in dy by writing dy
= p dx, namely λ dx, not only diminishes
 
with dx, but becomes a smaller and smaller fraction of dx: because
λ diminishes without limit
[169r] All this is conveniently signified in the language of Leibnitz, namely, that when dx is infinitely small, dy − p dx
is as nothing (or infinitely small) when compared with dx, or dy is (relatively to its own value) infinitely near to p dx.
The differential might easily be
avoided when there are only two variables, and even when there are more, provided we only want to use one independent variable at a time . Thus
u = φ(x, y, z) may give the equations
du=P, du=Q, du=R dx dy dz
But when we want to make
x, y, and z, all vary together,
we have no notion of a differential
coefficient attached to this simulta-
neous variation, unless we suppose some
one new variable on which x, y, and z
all depend, and the variation of which
sets them all varying together.
[169v] If this new variable be t, and
if x, y, and z be severally functions
of t, we have then
[in margin: ‘See chapter on Implicit differentiation’] d(u) =du ·dx +du[·]dy +du ·dz
dt dx dt dy dt dz dt
Thus if u = xy2ε2
d(u) =y2ε2dx +2xyε2dy +xy2ε2dz dt dt dt dt
  But observe that this makes x, y, and z, (which we want to be independent of one another) really functions of one another: thus if x = t2, y = log t, we must
have y = log√x. We might it is
true avoid this by the following suppo- sition. Let x, y, and z, instead of being given functions of t, be unassigned and

arbitrary functions, which we can always
make whatever functions we please. We can
then really hold dx dy dz to be indepen- dt dt dt
dent of one another, for it is always in our power to assign them any values we like.
But this method would be awkward , and would put continual impediments in our
way. It is better therefore to avoid that
[170r] notation which while it makes the
first step by supposing relations to exist between x, y, and z, immediately contradict that supposing by making these relations mean
any relations.
If in φ(x, yz) we suppose x, y, and z
to be simultaneously altered into x + ∆x, y + ∆y, z + ∆z, then φ(x, y z) takes the value
φ(x+∆x, y+∆y, z+∆z)
which may be expounded as follows
φ+ dφ∆x+ dφ∆y+ dφ∆z dx dy dz
+A∆x∆y + B∆y∆z + C∆z∆x +D∆x2 +E∆y2 +F∆z2
+ &c &c
say
φ + dφ ∆x + dφ ∆y + dφ ∆z + M
If it be required that φ = constant, or φ = c we must have
dφ ∆x + dφ ∆y + dφ ∆z + M = 0 dx dy dz
Now if we were to leave out M, and say
dφ ∆x + dφ ∆y + dφ ∆z = 0 dx dy dz
we should of course commit an error:
but it is one the magnitude of which
relatively to ∆x, for instance, diminishes
[170v] without limit as the increments ∆x, ∆y, ∆z, are diminished without limit. The considerations already given apply here again : because all the terms contain [sic] in M, diminish without limit as compared with those which
are not [something crossed out] contained in M. This rejection of all terms
dx dy dz
When therefore I say that φ = c
gives dφ .dx + dφ [.]dy + dφ .dz = 0 dx dy dz
except those of the first order is always accompanied and

I should, if asked whether this equation
is absolutely true, answer no . If then asked why I write it, I should answer
that it leads to truth , and for this
reason that it is more and more nearly true as dx &c are diminished : not because
dφdx+&c diminishesinthatcase,though dx
undoubtedly it does so ; but because it diminishes as compared with dx, &c. Hence, when we form ratios and take their limits,
it matters nothing, as to the results we obtain, whether we write
dφ dx + &c = −M dx
or dφ dx + &c = 0 dx
marked by writing dx for ∆x, dy for ∆y, &c.

Theorem. Page 199.
IfN beafunctionofxandy,giving dN =p+qdy dx dx
then the equation du = V. dN is incongruous & dx.dy dx.dy
self-contradictory, except upon the assumption that u is , as to x and y , a function of N ;
or contains x and y only thro’ N.
Let N = ψ(x, y) give y = χ(N, x) , and
suppose , if possible , that the substitution of
this value of y in u gives u = β(N, x) , x
not disappearing with y . Then x and y

I think the above is correct. I cannot see
[174v] the use (page 200) of introducing t in
the proof there given . Is it possible that
I have committed an error in my original
understanding of the ennunciation [sic] of the Theorem; & that the du [‘of the equation’ crossed out] and the dN of the equation du = V.dN , do not mean
the du and dN derived from differentiating with respect to the quantities x and y, already introduced ; but with respect
to [‘some’ crossed out] other given quantity?
I suspect so .
